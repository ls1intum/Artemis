#. :doc:`Quiz exercises <user/exercises/quiz>` with multiple choice, drag and drop and short answer quiz questions
#. :doc:`Modeling exercises <user/exercises/modeling>` with semi-automatic assessment using machine learning concepts
#. :doc:`Textual exercises <user/exercises/textual>` with manual (and experimental semi-automatic) assessment
