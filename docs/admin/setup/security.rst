Security
========


Passwords
---------

The Artemis configuration files contain a few default passwords and secrets
that have to be overridden in your own configuration files or via environment
variables (`Spring relaxed binding <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Relaxed-Binding-2.0>`_).

.. code-block:: yaml

    artemis:
        user-management:
            internal-admin:
                username: "artemis-admin"
                # can be changed later, Artemis will update the password in the database
                # and connected systems on the next start
                password: "artemis-admin"
    jhipster:
        security:
            authentication:
                jwt:
                    # used to sign the JWT tokens for user authentication
                    # can be changed later, will require all users to log in again
                    #
                    # encoded using Base64 (you can use `echo 'secret-key'|base64` on your command line)
                    base64-secret: ""
        registry:
            password: "change-me"  # only for distributed setups with multiple Artemis instances

    spring:
        prometheus:
            # if Prometheus monitoring is enabled: a comma-separated list of
            # IPs that are allowed to access the metrics endpoint
            monitoring-ip: "127.0.0.1"
        websocket:
            broker:
                username: "guest"  # only for distributed setups
                password: "guest"  # only for distributed setups


.. note::

    The usernames/passwords for external systems (GitLab,
    Jenkins, â€¦) are not listed here, since the general setup documentation
    describes how to set up those systems.
    Without replacing the default values, the connection to them will not work.


.. note::

    Ensure restrictive access to the configuration files, so that access is only
    possible for the system account that runs Artemis and administrators.
