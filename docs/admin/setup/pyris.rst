Pyris Setup Guide
=================

.. contents::

Prerequisites
-------------

- A server/VM or local machine
- **Python 3.12**: Ensure that Python 3.12 is installed.

  .. code-block:: bash

     python --version

  (Should be 3.12)

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Required for containerized deployment.

Local Environment Setup
-----------------------

1. **Clone the Pyris Repository**

   To get started with Pyris development, you need to clone the Pyris repository (`https://github.com/ls1intum/Pyris`) into a directory on your machine. For example, you can clone the repository into a folder called ``Pyris``.

   Example command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ls1intum/Pyris.git Pyris

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the Pyris directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd Pyris

   Install the required Python packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Create Configuration Files**

   - **Create an Application Configuration File**

     Create an ``application.local.yml`` file in the root directory. This file includes configurations used by the application.

     Example command:

     .. code-block:: bash

        cp Pyris/application.example.yml application.local.yml

     Example ``application.local.yml``:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        # Token that Artemis will use to access Pyris
        api_keys:
          - token: "your-secret-token"

        # Weviate Connection
        weaviate:
          host: "localhost"
          port: "8001"
          grpc_port: "50051"

        env_vars: {}

   The `env_vars` section allows you to define custom environment variables that can be accessed within the Pyris application. These can be used for various purposes, such as setting feature flags or defining environment-specific configurations. Currently, the `env_vars` section is not used by Pyris, but it can be utilized in future versions.

   - **Create LLM Config File**

     Create an ``llm_config.local.yml`` file in the root directory. This file includes a list of models with their configurations.

     Example command:

     .. code-block:: bash

        cp Pyris/llm_config.example.yml llm_config.local.yml

     **Example OpenAI Configuration**

     .. code-block:: yaml

        - id: "oai-gpt-35-turbo"
          name: "GPT 3.5 Turbo"
          description: "GPT 3.5 16k"
          type: "openai_chat"
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
          api_key: "<your_openai_api_key>"
          tools: []
          capabilities:
            input_cost: 0.5
            output_cost: 1.5
            gpt_version_equivalent: 3.5
            context_length: 16385
            vendor: "OpenAI"
            privacy_compliance: false
            self_hosted: false
            image_recognition: false
            json_mode: true

     **Example Azure OpenAI Configuration**

     .. code-block:: yaml

        - id: "azure-gpt-4-omni"
          name: "GPT 4 Omni"
          description: "GPT 4 Omni on Azure"
          type: "azure_chat"
          endpoint: "<your_azure_model_endpoint>"
          api_version: "2024-02-15-preview"
          azure_deployment: "gpt4o"
          model: "gpt4o"
          api_key: "<your_azure_api_key>"
          tools: []
          capabilities:
            input_cost: 5
            output_cost: 15
            gpt_version_equivalent: 4.5  # Equivalent GPT version of the model
            context_length: 128000
            vendor: "OpenAI"
            privacy_compliance: false
            self_hosted: false
            image_recognition: true
            json_mode: true

     **Explanation of Configuration Parameters**

     The configuration parameters are utilized through the capability system by pipelines in Pyris to select the appropriate model for a task. The parameter values under capabilities are mostly subjective and do not have any standard values.
     In the example configuration above, we orient the values based on the official documentation of the models.

     One can adjust the capabilities as the following example workflow:

        On their official website, OpenAI provides the following information about the `GPT-4o model <https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o>`_:

            - The model can process 128,000 tokens in a single request. So, we set the context_length to 128000.
            - The models is supposed to be better than GPT-4 in terms of its capabilities. So, we set the gpt_version_equivalent to 4.5.
            - The model is developed by OpenAI. So, we set the vendor to OpenAI.
            - We can not assume the if the service that provides the model, e.g. official OpenAI API or Azure, is compatible with the privacy regulations of the organisation. So, we set the privacy_compliance to false.
            - The model is not self-hosted. So, we set the self_hosted to false.
            - The model supports image recognition. So, we set the image_recognition to true.
            - The model supports structured JSON output mode. So, we set the json_mode to true.
            - The cost of input tokens for the model is 5$/1M tokens. So, we set the input_cost to 5.
            - The cost of output tokens for the model is 15$/1M tokens. So, we set the output_cost to 15.

     One thing to keep in mind regarding the parameter values under capabilities is that the values are used to compare and rank models based on the required capabilities specified by a pipeline to select an appropriate model for the task, the pipeline is performing.

     Next section provides a more detailed explanation of the parameters used in the configuration file.

     **Parameter Descriptions:**

     - ``api_key``: The API key for the model.
     - ``capabilities``: The capabilities of the model.

       - ``context_length``: The maximum number of tokens the model can process in a single request.
       - ``gpt_version_equivalent``: The equivalent GPT version of the model in terms of overall capabilities.
       - ``image_recognition``: Whether the model supports image recognition.
       - ``input_cost``: The cost of input tokens for the model. The capability system will prioritize models with lower or equal input costs. The value can be determined by the admin according to model's pricing. A more expensive model can have a higher input cost.
       - ``output_cost``: The cost of output tokens for the model. The capability system will prioritize models with lower or equal output costs.The value can be determined by the admin according to model's pricing. A more expensive model can have a higher output cost.
       - ``json_mode``: Whether the model supports structured JSON output mode.
       - ``privacy_compliance``: Whether the model complies with privacy regulations. If true, capability system will prioritize privacy-compliant models. Privacy compliant models can be determined by the system admins according to organizational and legal requirements.
       - ``self_hosted``: Whether the model is self-hosted. If true, capability system will prioritize self-hosted models
       - ``vendor``: The provider of the model (e.g., OpenAI). This option is used by the capability system to filter models by vendor.
       - ``speed``: The model's processing speed.

     - ``description``: Additional information about the model.
     - ``id``: Unique identifier for the model across all models.
     - ``model``: The official name of the model as used by the vendor.
     - ``name``: A custom, human-readable name for the model.
     - ``type``: The model type, used to select the appropriate client (Currently available types are: ``openai_chat``, ``azure_chat``, ``ollama``).
     - ``endpoint``: The URL to connect to the model.
     - ``api_version``: The API version to use with the model.
     - ``azure_deployment``: The deployment name of the model on Azure.
     - ``tools``: The tools supported by the model. For now, we do not provide any predefined tools, but the field is necessary for the models with tool calling capabilities.

     **Notes on ``gpt_version_equivalent``:**

     The ``gpt_version_equivalent`` field is subjective and used to compare capabilities of different models using GPT models as a reference. For example:

     - GPT-4 Omni equivalent: 4.5
     - GPT-4 Omni Mini equivalent: 4.25
     - GPT-4 equivalent: 4.0
     - GPT-3.5 equivalent: 3.5

     .. warning::

        Most existing pipelines in Pyris require a model with a ``gpt_version_equivalent`` of 4.5 or higher. It is advised to define models in the ``llm_config.local.yml`` file with a ``gpt_version_equivalent`` of 4.5 or higher.

     **Required Pipeline Capabilities:**

     Below are the capabilities required by different pipelines in Pyris.

     1. **Exercise Chat Pipeline**
          - ``gpt_version_equivalent``: 4.5,
          - ``context_length``: 128000,
     2. **Course Chat Pipeline**
          - ``gpt_version_equivalent``: 4.5,
          - ``context_length``: 128000,
          - ``json_mode``: true,
     3. **Lecture Chat Pipeline** - Used by exercise and course chat pipelines
          - ``gpt_version_equivalent``: 3.5,
          - ``context_length``: 16385,
          - ``json_mode``: true,
     4. **Interaction Suggestions Pipeline** - Used by exercise and course chat pipelines
          - ``gpt_version_equivalent``: 4.5,
          - ``context_length``: 128000,
          - ``json_mode``: true


     .. warning::
         When defining models in the ``llm_config.local.yml`` file, ensure that there are models with capabilities defined above in order to meet the requirements of the pipelines. Otherwise pipelines may not be able to perform as well as expected, i.e. the quality of responses generated by the pipelines may be suboptimal.

4. **Run the Server**

   Start the Pyris server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      APPLICATION_YML_PATH=./application.local.yml \
      LLM_CONFIG_PATH=./llm_config.local.yml \
      uvicorn app.main:app --reload

5. **Access API Documentation**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation.

This setup should help you run the Pyris application on your local machine. Ensure you modify the configuration files as per your specific requirements before deploying.
