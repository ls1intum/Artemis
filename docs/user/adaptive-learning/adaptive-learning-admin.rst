Standardized Competencies
-------------------------

| The **Standardized Competency Catalog** is a catalog of competencies that is accessible to all instructors in an Artemis instance.
  Instructors may view this catalog and import competencies from it into their course.
| The competencies consist of a title, description and taxonomy. Instead of being tied to specific courses, competencies are organized under knowledge areas.
| Knowledge areas may also contain other knowledge areas, enabling a hierarchical structure (e.g., Artificial Intelligence -> Machine Learning).

| Administrators can manage the standardized competency catalog of their Artemis instance
  in the *Standardized Competency Management* view.

| They can filter the displayed content by competency title and knowledge area.
  Clicking on a knowledge area expands it and clicking on the eye icon shows the knowledge area details on the right.
| From this details view they can edit or delete the knowledge area, or create new knowledge areas and competencies under it.
  Likewise, clicking on a standardized competency opens its details, allowing administrators to edit or delete it.
| Finally, administrators can also import a standardized competency catalog from a JSON file,
  or export the standardized competency catalog of their Artemis instance into a JSON file.

Import a Standardized Competency Catalog
----------------------------------------

.. note::

    To obtain a file containing a standardized competency catalog, you can contact the Artemis developer team.


| When importing, administrators first view a collapsible example of the expected file structure.
  They can then select a file containing standardized competencies from their local system.
| Artemis displays a preview of the knowledge areas and competencies that will be imported
  and administrators can view the details for each competency by clicking on it.
| After clicking on import, the complete catalog will be imported into the Artemis instance.
