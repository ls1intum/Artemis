Overview
--------

Artemis supports native mobile applications available for both `Android <https://github.com/ls1intum/artemis-android>`_ and `iOS <https://github.com/ls1intum/artemis-ios>`_. We designed them to be applicable in lecture usage. Users can, for example, participate in quizzes and write questions. Furthermore, they can communicate with each other.

Both apps use native user interface components and are adapted to their associated operating system. Therefore, they can differ in their usage.

The mobile applications have been designed to be compatible with all Artemis instances. Therefore, users of all Artemis instances can use the mobile application provided by us. Nevertheless, it is possible to fork our repositories and release your own versions of the mobile applications.

Below, we only explain the functionalities of the mobile applications that differ or are not present in the web application. For all other features, which are supported by both the mobile applications and the web application, please refer to their associated documentation.

Server Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installation, users have to first decide which Artemis server they want to connect to. Per default, the user can choose between the following instances:

* TUM: https://artemis.cit.tum.de
* CodeAbility: https://artemis.codeability.uibk.ac.at
* KIT: https://artemis.praktomat.cs.kit.edu

Furthermore, users have the option to select a custom instance. To do this, scroll down the list of servers to the bottom. Then, select "custom instance":

|server-selection-overview-android|

Then, enter the URL of the server as you would enter it into the browser:

|custom-server-entered-android|

The "Set custom instance" button will be enabled if the client could connect successfully to Artemis.

Push Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users may receive push notifications on their Android clients. When first logging in to an Artemis instance, users will be asked if they want to receive push notifications on that device.
