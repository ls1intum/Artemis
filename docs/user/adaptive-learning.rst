Adaptive Learning
=================

Overview
--------
Adaptive Learning in Artemis is centered around **competencies**, overarching learning objectives that tie together various lectures and exercises. Artemis is also able to provide students with individualized **learning paths** based on competencies and their relations.

Students are able to track their progress in :ref:`competencies_student` and can view the next recommended content in their :ref:`learning_paths_student`.

Instructors have multiple ways to add competencies to their course: They can create new competencies, :ref:`importing existing ones <import_competencies>` or :ref:`generate competencies <generate_competencies>` with Iris.
They can then link exercises and lecture units to competencies and define relations between them to build a structure for learning paths.

Administrators are able to :ref:`manage the standardized competency catalog <standardized_competency_catalog>`, an instance-wide catalog from which instructors can import competencies into their course.
