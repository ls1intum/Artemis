Overview

Conducting a text exercise consists of 3 steps:

1. **Instructor prepares exercise:** Instructor creates and configures the text exercise in Artemis.
2. **Student solves exercise:** Student works on the exercise and submits the solution.
3. **Tutor assesses submissions:** Tutor reviews the submitted exercises and creates results for the students.


Setup
-----

The following sections describe the supported features and the process of creating a new text exercise.

The following screenshot illustrates the last section of the form:

- **Linked Competencies**: In case instructors created competencies, they can link them to the exercise here. See :ref:`Adaptive Learning <adaptive-learning>` for more information.
- **Assessment Instructions**: Assessment instructions (comparable to grading rubrics) simplify the grading process. They include predefined feedback and points. Reviewers can drag and drop a suitable instruction to the text element to apply it during the assessment. The **Credits** specify the score of the instruction. The **Scale** describes the performance level of the instruction (e.g., excellent, good, average, poor). The **Description** may include additional notes about when to apply this instruction. **Feedback** is an explanatory text for the students to understand their performance level better. The **Limit** specifies how many times the score of this instruction may be included in the final score.
