Overview
--------

Artemis offers different exercise types that have these things in common:

- **Release Date:** The date at which the exercise is released to the students. When an exercise does not have a release date, it is shown to the students immediately.
- **Due Date:** The date until the students can submit their solution.
- **Assessment Due Date:** The date until the tutors should finish the assessment of the student submissions. All assessments prior to this date will be released on the assessment due date.
- **Points:** You can achieve points in each exercise. Depending on the exercise configuration these points are not included in the course score, count towards the course score or are used as bonus points.
