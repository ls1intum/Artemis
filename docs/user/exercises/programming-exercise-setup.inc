Features
^^^^^^^^

Artemis and its version control and continuous integration infrastructure is independent of the programming language and thus supports
teaching and learning with any programming language that can be compiled and tested on the command line.
Instructors have a lot of freedom in defining the environment (e.g. using build agents and Docker images) in which student code is executed and tested.
To simplify the setup of programming exercises, Artemis supports several ``templates`` that show how the setup works.
Instructors can still use those templates to generate programming exercises and then adapt and customize the settings in the repositories and build plans.


- The support for a specific programming language ``templates`` depends on the used ``continuous integration`` system. The table below gives an overview:

  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Programming Language | Bamboo | Jenkins | GitLab CI | Local CI |
  +======================+========+=========+===========+==========+
  | Java                 | yes    | yes     | yes       | yes      |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Python               | yes    | yes     | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | C                    | yes    | yes     | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Haskell              | yes    | yes     | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Kotlin               | yes    | yes     | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | VHDL                 | yes    | no      | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Assembler            | yes    | no      | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | Swift                | yes    | yes     | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+----------+
  | OCaml                | yes    | no      | no        | no       |
  +----------------------+--------+---------+-+---------+----------+

- Not all ``templates`` support the same feature set and supported features can also change depending on the continuous integration system set up.
  Depending on the feature set, some options might not be available during the creation of the programming exercise.
  The table below provides an overview of the supported features.
  In case a feature has different support for different continuous integration systems, the table shows the differences between Bamboo **(B)**, Jenkins **(J)**, GitLab CI **(G)**, and Local CI **(L)**.

  - *Sequential Test Runs*: ``Artemis`` can generate a build plan which first executes structural and then behavioral tests. This feature can help students to better concentrate on the immediate challenge at hand.
  - *Static Code Analysis*: ``Artemis`` can generate a build plan which additionally executes static code analysis tools.
    ``Artemis`` categorizes the found issues and provides them as feedback for the students. This feature makes students aware of code quality issues in their submissions.
  - *Plagiarism Checks*: ``Artemis`` is able to automatically calculate the similarity between student submissions. A side-by-side view of similar submissions is available to confirm the plagiarism suspicion.
  - *Package Name*: A package name has to be provided
  - *Solution Repository Checkout*: Instructors are able to compare a student submission against a sample solution in the solution repository
  - *Testwise Coverage Analysis*: ``Artemis`` can generate a build plan which additionally executes a testwise coverage analysis.
    ``Artemis`` aggregates the recorded data into different metrics. This feature allows instructors to check which code in the solution submission is how often executed by the test cases.
  - *Publish Build Plan*: ``Artemis`` can display the URL to the build plan (e.g. on Bamboo or Jenkins) to the student. This will not work for the upcoming internal continuous integration system that has no graphical user interface.

.. note::
  Only some ``templates`` for ``Bamboo`` support ``Sequential Test Runs`` at the moment.

.. note::
  Static Code Analysis for ``C`` exercises is only supported for ``Bamboo`` at the moment.

.. note::
  Testwise Coverage Analysis is only supported for ``Bamboo`` and exercises with regular test runs at the moment.

.. note::
  Instructors are still able to extend the generated programming exercises with additional features that are not available in one specific template.

.. note::
  Documentation for FACT framework can be found here: https://fact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

We encourage instructors to contribute improvements to the existing ``templates`` or to provide new templates. Please contact Stephan Krusche and/or create Pull Requests in the GitHub repository.

- Artemis provides various options to customize programming exercises:

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-naming.png
              :align: center

    - **Title:** The title of the exercise. It is used to create a project on the VCS server for the exercise.
      Instructors can change the title of the exercise after its creation.
    - **Short Name:** Together with the course short name, the exercise short name is used as a unique identifier for
      the exercise across Artemis (incl. repositories and build plans). The short name **cannot** be changed after the
      creation of the exercise.
    - **Preview**: Given the short name of the exercise and the short name of the course, Artemis displays a preview of the
      generated repositories and build plans.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-auxiliary-repositories.png
              :align: center

    - **Auxiliary Repositories:** Instructors can add auxiliary repositories with a name, checkout directory and description.
      These repositories are created and added to the build plan when the exercise is created. Auxiliary repositories
      cannot be changed after the creation of the exercise.

      .. note::
              Auxiliary repositories are checked out to the specified checkout directory during the automatic testing
              of a student submission in case the checkout directory is set. This can be used e.g. for providing
              additional resources or overwriting template source code in testing exercises.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-general-information.png
              :align: center

    - **Categories:** Instructors can freely define up to two categories per exercise. The categories are visible to students
      and should be used consistently to group similar kinds of exercises.
    - **Difficulty:** Instructors can give students information about the difficulty of the exercise.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-mode.png
              :align: center

    - **Mode:** The mode determines whether students work on the exercise alone or in teams. **Cannot** be changed after the exercise creation.
    - **Team size:** If ``Team`` mode is chosen, instructors can additionally give recommendations for the team size. Instructors/Tutors define the teams after
      the exercise creation.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-programming-language.png
              :align: center

    - **Programming Language:** The programming language for the exercise. Artemis chooses the template accordingly.
      Refer to the :ref:`programming exercise features <programming_features>` for an overview of the supported features for each template.
    - **Project Type:** Determines the project structure of the template. Not available for all programming languages.
    - **With exemplary dependency:** Adds an external Apache commons-lang dependency to the generated project as an example
      how maven dependencies should be used with Artemis exercises. Only available for Java exercises.
    - **Package Name:** The package name used for this exercise. Not available for all programming languages.

              :align: center
    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-timeline-automatic.png
              :align: center

    - **Release Date:** Release date of the exercise. Students will only be able to participate in the exercise after this date.
    - **Automatic Tests:** Every commit of a participant triggers the execution of the tests in the **Test** repository.
      Excluded are tests, which are specified to run after the due date. This is only possible if **Run Tests once after Due Date** has been activated.
      The tests that only run after the due date are chosen in the :ref:`grading configuration <configure_grading>`.
    - **Due Date:** The deadline for the exercise. Commits made after this date are not graded.
    - **Complaint on Automatic Assessment:** This option allows students to write a complaint on the automatic assessment after the due date.
        This option is only available if complaints are enabled in the course or the exercise is part of an exam.

      .. note::
        Students can still commit code and receive feedback after the exercise due date, if manual review and complaints are not activated.
        The results for these submissions will not be rated.

    - **Run Tests once after Due Date:** Activate this option to build and test the latest in-time submission of each student on this date.
      This date must be after the due date. The results created by this test run will be rated.
    - **Manual Review:** Instructors/Tutors have to manually review the latest student submissions after the automatic tests were executed.
    - **Assessment Due Date:** The deadline for the manual reviews. On this date, all manual assessments will be released to the students.
    - **Example Solution Publication Date:** The date when the solution repository becomes available to download for students. If left blank, example solutions are never published.

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-score.png
              :align: center

    - **Should this exercise be included in the course / exam score calculation?**

      - ``Yes``: Instructors can define the maximum achievable **Points** and **Bonus points** for the exercise.
        The achieved total points will count towards the total course/exam score
      - ``Bonus``: The achieved **Points** will count towards the total course/exam score as a bonus.
      - ``No``: The achieved **Points** will **not** count towards the total course/exam score.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/submission-policy-none-form.png
              :align: center

    - **Submission Policy:** Configure an initial submission policy for the exercise.
      The submission policy defines the effect that a submission has on the participation of one participant in a programming exercise.
      You can choose between 3 different types of submission policies: *None*, *Lock Repository*, *Submission Penalty*. Those policies can be used
      to limit how many times student can submit their code and receive feedback from automated tests. The feature and configuration
      is independent from programming language settings and works in combination with static code analysis penalties.
      Detailed information about the different types of policies and their respective setup can be found in the section
      :ref:`configuring submission policies <configure_submission_policies>`.

      .. note::
        Submission policies can only be edited on the Grading Page of the programming exercise after the initial exercise generation.

    |

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-sca.png
              :align: center

    - **Enable Static Code Analysis:** Enable static code analysis for the exercise.
      The build plans will additionally execute static code analysis tools to find code quality issues in the submissions.
      This option cannot be changed after the exercise creation. Artemis provides a default configuration for the static code analysis tools
      but instructors are free to :ref:`configure the static code analysis tools <configure_static_code_analysis_tools>`.
      Refer to the :ref:`programming exercise features <programming_features>` to see which programming languages support static code analysis.
    - **Max Static Code Analysis Penalty:** Available if static code analysis is active.
      Determines the maximum amount of points that can be deducted for code quality issues found in a submission as a percentage (between 0% and 100%) of **Points**.
      Defaults to 100% if left empty. Further options to configure the grading of code quality issues are available in the :ref:`grading configuration <configure_grading>`.

      .. note::
        Given an exercise with 10 **Points**. If **Max Static Code Analysis Penalty** is 20%, at most 2 points will be deducted
        from the points achieved by passing test cases for code quality issues in the submission.

    .. figure:: programming/programming-options-advanced-configuration.png
              :align: center

    - **Sequential Test Runs:** Activate this option to first run structural and then behavior tests.
      This feature allows students to better concentrate on the immediate challenge at hand.
      Not supported together with static code analysis. Cannot be changed after the exercise creation.
    - **Check out repository of sample solution:** Activate this option to checkout the solution into the 'solution' path.
      This option is useful to compare the student's submission with the sample solution. This option is not available for all programming languages.
    - **Allow Offline IDE:** Allow students to clone their personal repository and work on the exercise with their preferred IDE.
    - **Allow Online Editor:** Allow students to work on the exercise using the Artemis Online Code Editor.
    - **Record Testwise Coverage:** Activate this option to record the testwise coverage for the solution repository.
      This option is only available for Java/Kotlin-exercises with non-sequential test runs.

      .. note::
        At least one of the options **Allow Offline IDE:** and **Allow Online Editor:** must be active

    - **Show Test Names to Students:** Activate this option to show the names of the automated test cases to the students.
      If this option is disabled, students will not be able to visually differentiate between automatic and manual feedback.
    - **Publish Build Plan:** Allow students to access and edit their personal build plan. Useful for exercises where students should
      configure parts of the build plan themselves.

- Click on |generate| to create the exercise

  Result: **Programming Exercise**

    .. figure:: programming/course-dashboard-exercise-programming.png
              :align: center

  Artemis creates the repositories:

  - **Template:** template code, can be empty, all students receive this code at the beginning of the exercises
  - **Test:** contains all test cases, e.g. based on JUnit and optionally static code analysis configuration files. The repository is hidden for students
  - **Solution:** solution code, typically hidden for students, can be made available after the exercise

  Artemis creates two build plans

  - **Template:** also called BASE, basic configuration for the test + template repository, used to create student build plans
  - **Solution:** also called SOLUTION, configuration for the test + solution repository, used to manage test cases and to verify the exercise configuration

3. **Update exercise code in repositories**

- **Alternative 1:** Clone the 3 repositories and adapt the code on your local computer in your preferred development environment (e.g. Eclipse).

  - To execute tests, copy the template (or solution) code into a folder **assignment** in the test repository and execute the tests (e.g. using maven clean test)
  - Commit and push your changes |submit|

  - **Notes for Haskell:** In addition to the assignment folder, the executables of the build file expect the solution repository checked out in the **solution** subdirectory of the test folder and also allow for a **template** subdirectory to easily test the template on your local machine.
    You can use the following script to conveniently checkout an exercise and create the right folder structure:

    .. code-block:: bash

      #!/bin/sh
      # Arguments:
      # $1: exercise short name as specified on Artemis
      # $2: (optional) output folder name
      #
      # Note: you might want to adapt the `BASE` variable below according to your needs

      if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "No exercise short name supplied."
        exit 1
      fi

      EXERCISE="$1"

      if [ -z "$2" ]; then
        # use the exercise name if no output folder name is specified
        NAME="$1"
      else
        NAME="$2"
      fi

      # default base URL to repositories; change this according to your needs
      BASE="ssh://git@bitbucket.ase.in.tum.de:7999/$EXERCISE/$EXERCISE"

      # clone the test repository
      git clone "$BASE-tests.git" "$NAME" && \
        # clone the template repository
        git clone "$BASE-exercise.git" "$NAME/template" && \
        # clone the solution repository
        git clone "$BASE-solution.git" "$NAME/solution" && \
        # create an assignment folder from the template repository
        cp -R "$NAME/template" "$NAME/assignment" && \
        # remove the .git folder from the assignment folder
        rm -r "$NAME/assignment/.git/"

  - **Notes for OCaml:** The tests expect to be placed in a folder **tests** next to a folder **assignment** containing the submission to test and a folder **solution** with the solution repository.
    You can use the following script to conveniently checkout an exercise and create the right folder structure:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ln "$NAME/solution/src/assignment.mli" "$NAME/tests/solution/solution.mli"

    To run the tests run the following script in either the solution or template folder:

    .. code-block:: bash

      #!/bin/sh
      dir="$(realpath ./)"

      cd .. || exit 1
      rm ./assignment
      ln -s "$dir" ./assignment
      cd tests || exit 1
      ./run.sh

    It is possible to checkout additional student repositories next to the solution and template folder to run tests on them for manual grading.


- **Alternative 2:** Open |edit-in-editor| in Artemis (in the browser) and adapt the code in online code editor

  - You can change between the different repos and submit the code when needed

  **Edit in Editor**

  .. figure:: programming/instructor-editor.png
            :align: center

- **Alternative 3:** Use IntelliJ with the Orion plugin and change the code directly in IntelliJ

- Check the results of the template and the solution build plan
- They should not have the status |build_failed|
- In case of a |build_failed| result, some configuration is wrong, please check the build errors on the corresponding build plan.
- **Hints:** Test cases should only reference code, that is available in the template repository. In case this is **not** possible, please try out the option **Sequential Test Runs**

4. **Optional:** Adapt the build plans

- The build plans are preconfigured and typically do not need to be adapted
- However, if you have additional build steps or different configurations, you can adapt the BASE and SOLUTION build plan as needed
- When students start the programming exercise, the current version of the BASE build plan will be copied. All changes in the configuration will be considered

.. _configure_static_code_analysis_tools:

5. **Optional:** Configure static code analysis tools

- The **Test** repository contains files for the configuration of static code analysis tools, if static code analysis was activated during the creation/import of the exercise
- The folder *staticCodeAnalysisConfig* contains configuration files for each used static code analysis tool
- On exercise creation, Artemis generates a default configuration for each tool, which contains a predefined set of parameterized activated/excluded rules. The configuration files serve as a documented template that instructors can freely tailor to their needs.
- On exercise import, Artemis copies the configuration files from the imported exercise
- The following table depicts the supported static code analysis tools for each programming language, the dependency mechanism used to execute the tools and the name of their respective configuration files

+----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Programming Language | Execution Mechanism       | Supported Tools               | Configuration File           |

+----------------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------+

.. note::
  The Maven plugins for the Java static code analysis tools provide additional configuration options.

.. note::
    GCC can be configured by passing the desired flags in the tasks. For more information, see `GCC Documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.1.0/gcc/Static-Analyzer-Options.html>`__.

- The build plans use a special task/script for the execution of the tools

.. note::
  Instructors are able to completely disable the usage of a specific static code analysis tool by removing the plugin/dependency from the execution mechanism.
  In case of Maven plugins, instructors can remove the unwanted tools from the *pom.xml* or *build.gradle*.
  Alternatively, instructors can alter the task/script that executes the tools in the build plan.
  PMD and PMD CPD are a special case as both tools share a common plugin. To disable one or the other, instructors must delete the execution of a tool from the build plan.

.. _interactive_problem_statement:

6. Adapt the interactive problem statement

  .. figure:: programming/course-dashboard-programming-edit.png
            :align: center

- Click the |edit| button of the programming exercise or navigate into |edit-in-editor| and adapt the interactive problem statement.
- The initial example shows how to integrate tasks, link tests and integrate interactive UML diagrams

.. _configure_grading:

7. Configure Grading

- **General Actions**

  - |grading-save| Save the current grading configuration of the open tab
  - |grading-reset| Reset the current grading configuration of the open tab to the default values. For **Test Case Tab**, all test cases are set to weight 1, bonus multiplier 1 and bonus points 0. For the **Code Analysis Tab**, the default configuration depends on the selected programming language.
  - |grading-reevaluate-all| Re-evaluates all scores according to the currently saved settings using the individual feedback stored in the database
  - |grading-trigger-all| Trigger all build plans. This leads to the creation of new results using the updated grading configuration
  - Two badges display if the current configuration has been saved yet and if the grading was changed. The following graphic visualizes how each action affects the grading page state:

  .. figure:: programming/configure-grading-update-information.png
            :align: center

  .. warning::
    Artemis always grades new submissions with the latest configuration but existing submissions might have been graded with an outdated configuration. Artemis warns instructors about grading inconsistencies with the **Updated grading** badge.

- **Test Case Tab**: Adapt the contribution of each test case to the overall score

  .. figure:: programming/configure-grading-test-cases.png
            :align: center

  .. note::
    Artemis registers the test cases defined in the **Test** repository using the results generated by **Solution** build plan. The test cases are only shown after the first execution of the **Solution** build plan.

  - On the left side of the page, instructors can configure the test case settings:

    - **Test Name**: Name of the test case as defined in **Test** repository
    - **Weight**: The points for a test case are proportional to the weight (sum of all weights as the denominator) and are calculated as a fraction of the maximum points

    .. note::
      Bonus points for an exercise (implied by a score higher than 100%) are only achievable if at least one bonus multiplier is greater than 1 or bonus points are given for a test case

    - **Bonus multiplier**: Allows instructors to multiply the points for passing a test case without affecting the points rewarded for passing other test cases
    - **Bonus points**: Adds a flat point bonus for passing a test case
    - **Visibility**: Select the visibility of feedbacks to students for this test case.

      - **Always**: Feedback associated with this test case is visible to students directly after the automatic grading process for their submission.
      - **After Due Date**: Feedback associated with this test case is visible to students only after the due date for this exercise has passed.
        Tutors and Instructors are able to see the feedback before the due date.

        If for some students an individual due date is set, the detailed feedback for those tests is invisible to all other students until the exercise submission is no longer possible for all students.
        Other students can however still see if the tests passed or failed and receive points accordingly, even if the latest individual due has not passed yet.

        .. warning ::
          For manual assessments all feedback details will be visible to this student, even if the due date has not passed yet for others.
          Tutors can start the manual assessment for all students with the regular due date as soon as it has passed.
          Set an appropriate assessment due date in the exercise settings to make sure that students cannot tell still working students about the test case details.
      - **Never**: Feedback associated with this test case is *never* visible to students even after the due date for this exercise has passed.
        Tutors and Instructors are able to see the feedback before and after the due date, e.g. when manually assessing submissions.
        Additionally, results of this test case are *not* considered in the student score calculation.

    - **Is Active**: Displays whether the test case is currently part of the grading configuration. The *Show inactivate test cases* controls whether inactive test cases are displayed
    - **Passed %**: Displays statistics about the percentage of participating students that passed or failed the test case

    .. note::
      **Example 1**: Given an exercise with 3 test cases, maximum points of 10 and 10 achievable bonus points. The highest achievable score is :math:`\frac{10+10}{10}*100=200\%`. Test Case (TC) A has weight 2, TC B and TC C have weight 1 (bonus multipliers 1 and bonus points 0 for all test cases). A student that only passes TC A will receive 50% of the maximum points (5 points).

    .. note::
      **Example 2**: Given the configuration of **Example 1** with an additional bonus multiplier of 2 for TC A. Passing TC A accounts for :math:`\frac{2*2}{2+1+1}*100=100\%` of the maximum points (10). Passing TC B or TC C accounts for :math:`\frac{1}{4}*100=25\%` of the maximum points (2.5). If the student passes all test cases he will receive a score of 150%, which amounts to 10 points and 5 bonus points.

    .. note::
      **Example 3**: Given the configuration of **Example 2** with additional bonus points of 5 for TC B. The points achieved for passing TC A and TC C do not change. Passing TC B now accounts for 2.5 points plus 5 bonus points (7.5). If the student passes all test cases he will receive 10 (TC A) + 7.5 (TC B) + 2.5 (TC C) points, which amounts to 10 points and 10 bonus points and a score of 200%.

  - On the right side of the page, charts display statistics about the current test case configuration. If changes are made to the configuration, a |grading-preview| of the statistics is shown.

    - **Weight Distribution**: The distribution of test case weights. Visualizes the impact of each test case for the score calculation
    - **Total Points**: The percentage of points given to students according to a specific test case. 100% in the chart represents full scores (100%) of **all** students

- **Code Analysis Tab**: Configure the visibility and grading of code quality issues on a category-level

  .. figure:: programming/configure-grading-code-analysis.png
            :align: center

  .. note::
    The Code Analysis Tab is only available if static code analysis was activated for the exercise.

  - Code quality issues found during the automatic assessment of a submission are grouped into categories. Artemis maps categories defined by the static code analysis tools to Artemis categories according to the following table:

  .. note::
    For Swift, only the category Code Style can contain code quality issues currently. All other categories displayed on the grading page are dummies.

  .. note::
    The GCC SCA option for C does not offer categories by default. The issues were categorized during parsing with respect to the :ref:`rules <c_sca_default_config>`.

  - On the left side of the page, instructors can configure the static code analysis categories.

    - **Category**: The name of category defined by Artemis
    - **State**:

      - ``INACTIVE``: Code quality issues of an inactive category are not shown to students and do not influence the score calculation
      - ``FEEDBACK``: Code quality issues of a feedback category are shown to students but do not influence the score calculation
      - ``GRADED``: Code quality issues of a graded category are shown to students and deduct points according to the Penalty and Max Penalty configuration
    - Penalty: Artemis deducts the selected amount of points for each code quality issue from points achieved by passing test cases
    - Max Penalty: Limits the amount of points deducted for code quality issues belonging to this category
    - Detected Issues: Visualizes how many students encountered a specific number of issues in this category

8. Verify the exercise configuration

- Open the |view| page of the programming exercise

    .. figure:: programming/solution-template-result.png
              :align: center

- The template result should have a score of **0%** with **0 of X passed** or **0 of X passed, 0 issues** (if static code analysis is enabled)
- The solution result should have a score of **100%** with **X of X passed** or **X of X passed, 0 issues** (if static code analysis is enabled)

.. note::
  If static code analysis is enabled and issues are found in the template/solution result, instructors should improve the template/solution or disable the rule, which produced the unwanted/unimportant issue.

- Click on |edit|

  - Below the problem statement, you should see **Test cases** ok and **Hints** ok

Exercise Import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On exercise import, Artemis copies the repositories, build plans, interactive problem statement and grading configuration from the imported exercise.

1. **Open Course Management**

- Open |course-management|
- Navigate into **Exercises** of your preferred course

    .. figure:: general/course-management-course-dashboard-exercises.png
              :align: center

2. **Import programming exercise**

- Click on **Import Programming Exercise**

    .. figure:: programming/course-management-exercise-dashboard-import.png
              :align: center

- Select an exercise to import

    .. figure:: programming/course-management-exercise-dashboard-import-modal.png
              :align: center

.. note::
  Instructors can import exercises from courses, where they are registered as instructors

- Artemis provides special options to update the assessment process

    .. figure:: programming/programming-import-options.png
              :align: center

    - **Recreate Build Plans**: Create new build plans instead of copying them from the imported exercise
    - **Update Template**: Update the template files in the repositories. This can be useful if the imported exercise is old and contains outdated dependencies.
      For Java, Artemis replaces JUnit4 by Ares (which includes JUnit5) and updates the dependencies and plugins with the versions found in the latest template. Afterwards you might need to adapt the test cases.

- Instructors are able to activate/deactivate static code analysis. Changing this option from the original value, requires the activation of **Recreate Build Plans** and **Update Template**.

.. note::
  **Recreate Build Plans** and **Update Template** are automatically set if the static code analysis option changes compared to the imported exercise. The plugins, dependencies and static code analysis tool configurations are added/deleted/copied depending on the new and the original state of this option.

- Fill out all mandatory values and click on |import|

.. note::
  The interactive problem statement can be edited after finishing the import. Some options such as **Sequential Test Runs** cannot be changed on exercise import.
