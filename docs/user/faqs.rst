What Are FAQs in Artemis?
-------------------------

Artemis supports the coordination and management of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) within a course. These FAQs offer quick and clear answers to common questions from students, helping to streamline communication and make important information easily accessible.

To set up and manage FAQs, instructors can navigate to the **FAQ** page in the course administration section.
Before using the FAQ feature, a configuration step is required. Please ensure that the FAQ functionality is enabled in the course settings.

FAQ Management
-------------------------

The FAQ overview provides a user-friendly interface for managing questions.

At the top of the page, instructors can search for specific FAQs or filter them by topic. Below that, a list of all existing FAQs is shown in a table, making it easy to view and edit entries.

There is also a button to create new FAQs.
If the **IRIS** feature is enabled, an additional button allows all FAQs to be added to IRIS. This enables the virtual tutor to include FAQ content when answering student questions.

FAQ Table Details
-------------------------

Each FAQ is displayed in a table row with five main columns:

1. **Title** – the question itself.
2. **Answer** – the corresponding response.
3. **Status** – shows whether the FAQ is published, proposed, etc.
4. **Actions** – contains buttons to interact with the FAQ (e.g., edit or delete).

The number of visible action buttons depends on the user’s role:

Tutors can propose new FAQs and edit those that are still in the Proposed state, but they cannot approve or delete any FAQs.

Creating FAQs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FAQs can be created manually. Each FAQ consists of a question and an answer.
The question is shown as a heading, and the answer is presented as a formatted paragraph.

- The **title** is entered in a plain text field.
- The **answer** supports the full Markdown editor used in Artemis.


Additional IRIS Features: Automatic FAQ Rewriting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When **IRIS** is enabled, you can use an integrated feature to automatically refine your FAQs.
With just one click, IRIS checks your FAQ answers for grammar issues and unclear phrasing.
It analyzes the text, suggests improvements, and automatically updates the answer field with a more polished version to save you time and ensure high-quality responses.
In addition, a **consistency check** is performed to ensure that the answer aligns with existing FAQs.
