Continuous Integration
======================

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each change is automatically built and tested, which helps to:

- Detect and address integration issues early
- Ensure code quality and consistency
- Streamline the development process

Artemis Local CI is our implementation of these CI principles, tailored to support the Artemis learning platform.
It provides tools and views to help users build and test in programming exercises effectively.

This document will introduce you to the key components of Artemis Local CI: the Build Agent View and the Build Overview View.
These tools will assist you throughout your development workflow on the Artemis platform.
