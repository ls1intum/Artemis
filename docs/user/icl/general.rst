General Information
===================

Artemis offers the Integrated Code Lifecycle (ICL), a comprehensive feature designed to streamline the development process for programming exercises.
ICL combines version control, secure communication, and continuous integration to provide a seamless experience for students and instructors.
Understanding these components is crucial for effectively using Artemis, especially if you're new to concepts like SSH and Git. The key components of ICL are:

- :ref:`Local Version Control<local-vc>`:         Use the Local Version Control to interact with the repositories of programming exercises.
- :ref:`SSH<basic SSH introduction>`:             Use SSH to perform Git operations on repositories.
- :ref:`Local Continuous Integration<local-ci>`:  Exercise submissions are built and tested by the Local CI system.
