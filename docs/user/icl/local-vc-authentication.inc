Cloning a repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use Sourcetree, git from the terminal, or any client you like to clone your Git repository.
These instructions show you how to clone your repository using Git from the terminal.

From the exercise view, click the code button to display the Clone dialog.
Copy the clone URL (either the SSH format or the HTTPS, with or without token).
If you are using the SSH protocol, ensure your public key is stored in your Artemis account settings and loaded on the local system to which you are cloning.
From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.

Paste the command you copied from Bitbucket, for example:

Clone over HTTPS:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://username@artemis.cit.tum.de/course/documentation-tests.git


Clone over HTTPS with access token:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://username:accessToken@artemis.cit.tum.de/course/documentation-tests.git


Clone over SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone ssh://git@artemis.cit.tum.de/course/documentation-tests.git


If the clone was successful, a new sub-directory appears on your local drive.
This directory has the same name as the repository that you cloned.
The clone contains the files and metadata that Git requires to maintain the changes you make to the source files.

Choosing between HTTPS and SSH:

- HTTPS: Easier to set up initially, works through firewalls, but requires entering credentials more frequently.
- SSH: More secure, doesn't require entering passwords for each operation once set up, but initial setup can be more complex.

Choose HTTPS if you're new to Git or working in an environment with strict firewall rules.
Choose SSH for enhanced security and convenience in long-term development.

HTTPS access tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instructors can create HTTP access tokens for repository access in Artemis.
They are created in the account settings and are used in place of passwords for Git over HTTPS.
For every student's exercise, Artemis automatically generates an access token, only associated with the repository of this particular exercise.
You can use these to authenticate to the Artemis Local Version Control.

Token Creation
""""""""""""""

1. Go to Profile > Settings > VCS token.
2. Create a new token

Using SSH keys to secure Git operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Artemis provides a simple way for users to connect securely to repositories, using SSH to perform Git operations.
Next is a :ref:`small and basic introduction to SSH<basic SSH introduction>`, and if you already know it, :ref:`here is a guide on how to create SSH keys<create ssh key>`.
