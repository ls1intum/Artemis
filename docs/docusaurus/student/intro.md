# 👋 Welcome, Students!

This guide helps you navigate **Artemis** as a student — from understanding exercises and submitting solutions to viewing results and feedback.

Here, you’ll learn how to:

- Access and manage exercises of different types
- Work on programming, quiz, text, and modeling exercises
- Submit your work and review automated feedback
- Track your scores and progress in your courses

If you’re new to Artemis, start with the **[General Information](./general.md)** page to understand how exercises are organized.
