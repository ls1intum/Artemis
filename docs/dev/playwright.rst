E2E Testing with Playwright
===========================

Best practices for writing tests in Playwright
----------------------------------------------

1. **Use page objects for common interactions**:

    Page objects are a design pattern that helps to abstract the details of the page structure and interactions. They
    encapsulate the page elements and their interactions with the page. This makes the tests more readable and
    maintainable.
    Page objects are stored in the ``support/pageobjects`` folder. Each page object is implemented as a class containing
    a Playwright page instance and may have instances of other page objects as well. Page object classes provide methods
    performing common user actions or returning frequently used locators.
    Page objects are registered as fixtures to make them easily accessible in tests without caring about their
    initialization and teardown.

2. **Use fixtures**:

    Test fixture in Playwright is a setup environment that prepares the necessary conditions and state required for your
    tests to run. It helps manage the initialization and cleanup tasks so that each test starts with a known state.
    We use fixtures for all POMs and common test commands such as ``login``. Fixtures are defined in
    ``support/fixtures.ts``.

    To create a fixture, define its instance inside a corresponding existing type or define a new one:

    .. code-block:: typescript

        export type ArtemisPageObjects = {
            loginPage: LoginPage;
        }

    2. Ensure the base test (``base``) extends the fixture type. Define a fixture with the relevant name and return the
    desired instance as an argument of ``use()`` function as below:

    .. code-block:: typescript

        export const test = base.extend<ArtemisPageObjects>({
            loginPage: async ({ page }) => new LoginPage(page)
        });

    3. Inject the fixture to tests when needed as an argument to the ``test()`` function as follows:

    .. code-block:: typescript

        test('Test name', async ({ fixtureName }) => {
            // Test code
        });

3. **Use uniquely identifiable locators**:

    Use unique locators to identify elements on the page. Playwright throws an error when interacting with a locator
    that matches multiple elements on the page. To ensure uniqueness, use locators based on the element's
    ``data-testid``, ``id``, unique ``class`` or a combination of these attributes.

    Avoid using the ``nth()`` method or the ``nth-child`` selector, s they rely on the elementâ€™s position in the DOM
    hierarchy. Use these methods only when iterating over multiple similar elements.

    Avoid using locators that are prone to change. If a component lacks a unique selector,
    add a ``data-testid`` attribute with a unique value to its template. This ensures that the component is easily
    identifiable, making tests less likely to break when there are changes to the component.

4. **Consider actionability of elements**

    Checking for the state of an element before interacting with it is crucial to avoid flaky behavior. Actions like
    clicking a button or typing into an input field require a particular state from the element, such as visible and
    enabled, which makes it actionable.  Playwright ensures that the elements you interact with are actionable before
    performing such actions.

    However, some complex interactions may require additional checks to ensure the element is in the desired state. For
    example, consider a case where we want to access the inner text of an element that is not visible yet. Use ``waitFor()``
    function of a locator to wait for its ``visible`` state before accessing its inner text:

    .. code-block:: typescript

        await page.locator('.clone-url').waitFor({ state: 'visible' });
        const urlText = await this.page.locator('.clone-url').innerText();

    .. warning ::

        Avoid using ``page.waitForSelector()`` function to wait for an element to appear on the page. This function
        waits for the visibility in the DOM, but it does not guarantee that the element is actionable. Always
        prefer the ``waitFor()`` function of a locator instead.

    In some cases, we may need to wait for the page to load completely before interacting with its elements. Use
    ``waitForLoadState()`` function to wait for the page to reach a specified load state:

    .. code-block:: typescript

        await page.waitForLoadState('load');

    .. warning ::

        Waiting for the page load state is not recommended if we are only interested in specific elements appearing on
        the page - use ``waitFor()`` function of a locator instead.
