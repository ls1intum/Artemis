API Versioning
===========================

The API paths are prefixed with an optional version number. If the version number is not specified, the latest version is assumed. For example, if the latest version is 4, ``/api/v4/...`` is the same as ``/api/...``.

To create a new API version, extend the list of versions in the `VersioningConfiguration`. All endpoints with a lower limit will automatically support the new version.

There a three ways to specify what version an endpoint supports:
    - No versioning annotation: The endpoint supports all versions Artemis supports.
    - ``@VersionRange``: The endpoint supports all versions in the specified range or limit.
    - ``@VersionRanges``: The endpoint supports all versions in the specified ranges or limits. This annotation contains a list of ``@VersionRange`` annotations.

If a range contains two elements, an actual range is specified. ``@VersionRange{1,3}`` specifies that the endpoint accepts versions 1, 2, and 3, assuming that Artemis supports at least until version 3. If a range contains only one element, a lower limit is specified. ``@VersionRange{1}`` specifies that the endpoint accepts all versions starting from 1. ``@VersionRanges`` with no supplied parameters gets interpreted as no annotation. Hence, qualifies for all versions. Other configurations are illegal.

The ``VersioningTest`` tests all endpoints for correct versioning configuration and conflicts.

Currently, there is no documentation of the API available. Please refer to the code base for any available endpoints.
