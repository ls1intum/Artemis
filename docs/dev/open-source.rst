Open-Source
===========

We are dedicated to provide great software support for excellent teaching.
To achieve that, we develop Artemis as `free and open-source <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMi3PCW23yQ>`__ software.
The core ideas of free software always have been "use", "study", "share", and "improve".

With Artemis, we embrace all of those aspects:

* Artemis is **used** by over ten universities and thousands of students.
* Artemis is part of active research and is constantly improved by students as part of university courses or masters/bachelors theses.
  **Studying** the Artemis source code helps our students to improve their software engineering skills
  while working on a real, actively used product.
* The foundation of learning and teaching is **sharing** knowledge.
  Artemis is used to conduct courses at universities and, at the same time, used as an education research platform.
* With more than `140 contributors <https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/graphs/contributors>`__ and a
  `regular release cycle <https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/releases>`__, we are constantly **improving** Artemis.
