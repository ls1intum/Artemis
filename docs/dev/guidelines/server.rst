WORK IN PROGRESS

0. Folder structure
===================

The main application is stored under ``/src/main`` and the main folders are:

* resources - script, config files and templates are stored here.
    * config - different configurations (production, development, etc.) for application.
        * liquibase - contains ``master.xml`` file where all the changelogs from the changelog folder are specified.
                      When you want to do some changes to the database, you will need to add a new changelog file here.
                      To understand how to create new changelog file you can check existing changelog files or read documentation: https://www.liquibase.org/documentation/databasechangelog.html.
* java - Artemis Spring Boot application is located here. It contains the following folders:
    * config - different classes for configuring database, Sentry, Liquibase, etc.
    * domain - all the entities and data classes are located here (the model of the server application).
    * exception - store custom types of exceptions here. We encourage to create custom exceptions to help other developers understand what problem exactly happened.
                  This can also be helpful when we want to provide specific exception handling logic.
    * security - contains different POJOs (simple classes that don't implement/extend any interface/class and don't have annotations) and component classes related to security.
    * repository - used to access or change objects in the database. There are several techniques to query database: named queries, queries with SpEL expressions and Entity Graphs.
    * service - represents the controller of the server application. Add the application logic here. Retrieve and change objects using repositories.
    * web - contains two folders:
        * rest - contains REST controllers that act as the view of the server application. Validate input and security here, but do not include complex application logic
        * websocket - contains controllers that handle real-time communication with the client based on the Websocket protocol. Use the ``MessagingTemplate`` to push data to the client or to notify the client about events.

1. Naming convention
====================

All variables, methods and classes should use CamelCase style. The only difference: the first letter of any class should be capital. Most importantly use intention-revealing, pronounceable names.

2. Single responsibility principle
==================================

One method should be responsible for only one action, it should do it well and do nothing else. Reduce coupling, if our method does two or three different things at a time then we should consider splitting the functionality.

3. Small methods
================

There is no standard pattern for method length among the developers. Someone can say 5, in some cases even 20 lines of code is okay. Just try to make methods as small as possible.

4. Duplication
==============

Avoid code duplication. If we cannot reuse a method elsewhere, then the method is probably bad and we should consider a better way to write this method. Use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place.

5. Variables and methods declaration
====================================

* Encapsulate the code you feel might change in future.
* Make variables and methods private by default and increase access step by step by changing them from a private to package-private or protected first and not public right away.
* Classes, methods or functions should be open for extension and closed for modification (open closed design principle).
* Program for the interface and not for implementation, you should use interface type on variables, return types of a method or argument type of methods. Just like using SuperClass type to store object rather using SubClass.
* The use of interface is to facilitate polymorphism, a client should not implement an interface method if its not needed.
* Type inference of variables - var vs. actual type:
    * Variables with primitive types like int, long, or also String should be defined with the actual type by default.
    * Types which share similar functionality but require different handling should also be explicitly stated, e.g. Lists and Sets.
    * Variable types which are untypically long and would decrease readability when writing can be shortened with ``var`` (e.g. custom DTOs).

6. Structure your code correctly
================================

* Default packages are not allowed. It can cause particular problems for Spring Boot applications that use the ``@ComponentScan``, ``@EntityScan`` or ``@SpringBootApplication`` annotations since every class from every jar is read.
* All variables in the class should be declared at the top of the class.
* If a variable is used only in one method then it would be better to declare it as a local variable of this method.
* Methods should be declared in the same order as they are used (from top to bottom).
* More important methods should be declared at the top of a class and minor methods at the end.

7. Database
===========

* Write performant queries that can also deal with more than 1000 objects in a reasonable time.
* Prefer one query that fetches additional data instead of many small queries, but don't overdo it. A good rule of thumb is to query not more than 3 associations at the same time.
* Think about lazy vs. eager fetching when modeling the data types.
* Only if it is inevitable, use nested queries. You should try use as few tables as possible.
* Simple datatypes: immediately think about whether ``null`` should be supported as additional state or not. In most cases it is preferable to avoid ``null``.
* Use ``Datetime`` instead of ``Timestamp``. ``Datetime`` occupies more storage space compared to ``Timestamp``, however it covers a greater date range that justifies its use in the long run.

8. Comments
===========

Only write comments for complicated algorithms, to help other developers better understand them. We should only add a comment, if our code is not self-explanatory.

9. Utility
==========

Utility methods can and should be placed in a class named for specific functionality, not "miscellaneous stuff related to project". Most of the time, our static methods belong in a related class.

10. Auto configuration
======================

Spring Boot favors Java-based configuration.
Although it is possible to use Sprint Boot with XML sources, it is generally not recommended.
You don't have to put all your ``@Configuration`` into a single class.
The ``@Import`` annotation can be used to import additional configuration classes.
One of the flagship features of Spring Boot is its use of Auto-configuration. This is the part of Spring Boot that makes your code simply work.
It gets activated when a particular jar file is detected on the classpath. The simplest way to make use of it is to rely on the Spring Boot Starters.

11. Keep your ``@RestController``’s clean and focused
=====================================================

* RestControllers should be stateless.
* RestControllers are by default singletons.
* RestControllers should not execute business logic but rely on delegation.
* RestControllers should deal with the HTTP layer of the application.
* RestControllers should be oriented around a use-case/business-capability.
* RestControllers should return DTOs that are as small as possible

Route naming conventions:

* Always use kebab-case (e.g. ".../exampleAssessment" → ".../example-assessment").
* The routes should follow the general structure list-entity > entityId > sub-entity ... (e.g. "exercises/{exerciseId}/participations").
* Use plural for a route's list-entities (e.g. "exercises/..."), use singular for a singleton (e.g. ".../assessment"), use verbs for naming remote methods on the server (e.g. ".../submit").
* Specify the key entity at the end of the route (e.g. "text-editor/participations/{participationId}" should be changed to "participations/{participationId}/text-editor").
* Use consistent routes that start with ``courses``, ``exercises``, ``participations``, ``exams`` or ``lectures`` to simplify access control. Do not start routes with other entity names.
* When defining a new route, all subroutes should be addressable as well, e.g. your new route is "exercises/{exerciseId}/statistics", then both "exercises/{exerciseId}" and "exercises" should be addressable.
* If you want an alternative representation of the entity that e.g. sends extra data needed for assessment, then specify the reason for this alternative route at the end of the route, for example "participations/{participationId}/for-assessment".

Additional notes on the controller methods:

* The REST Controllers route should end with a tailing "/" and not start with a "/" (e.g. "api/"), the individual endpoints routes should not start and not end with a "/" (e.g. "exercises/{exerciseId}").
* Use ...ElseThrow alternatives of all Repository and AuthorizationCheck calls whenever applicable, this increases readability (e.g. ``findByIdElseThrow(...)`` instead of ``findById(...)`` and then checking for ``null``).
* POST should return the newly created entity.
* POST should be used to trigger remote methods (e.g. ".../{participationId}/submit" should be triggered with a POST).
* Verify that API endpoints perform appropriate authorization and authentication consistent with the rest of the code base.
    * Always use the Authorization enforcement logic described down below to only allow certain roles to access the method.
    * Perform additional security checks using the ``AuthorizationCheckService``.
* Check for other common weaknesses, e.g., weak configuration, malicious user input, missing log events, etc.
* Never trust user input and check if the passed data exists in the database.
    * Verify the consistency of user input by e.g. checking ids in body and path to see if they match, comparing course in the `RequestBody` with the one referenced by id in the path.
    * Check for user input consistency first, then check the authorization, if e.g. the ids of the course in body and path don't match, the user may be INSTRUCTOR in one course and just a USER in another, this may lead to unauthorized access.
* REST Controller should only handle authentication, error handling, input validation and output creation, the actual logic behind an endpoint should happen in the respective `Service` or `Repository`.
* Handle exceptions and errors with a standard response. Errors are very important in REST APIs. They inform clients that something went wrong, after all.
* Always use different response status codes to notify the client about errors on the server, e.g.:
    * Forbidden - the user is not authorized to access the controller.
    * Bad Request - the request was wrong.
    * Not Found - can't find the requested data or it should be not accessible yet.

.. _server-guideline-dto-usage:

12. Use DTOs for data transfer
==============================

Use data transfer objects (DTOs) to send data from the server to the client, i.e. responses of RestControllers and WebSocket messages.

Definition and Characteristics of DTOs:

1. Java Records: DTOs are implemented as Java records. Records do not support inheritance, so duplication for DTOs is ok.
2. No Entity Objects: DTOs must not contain entity objects, but only primitive types (or the corresponding wrapper classes), enums or other DTOs.
3. Minimal Data: DTOs should only include the minimum amount of data required by the client application. Avoid adding any unnecessary or redundant information.
4. Single Responsibility: Keep DTOs focused on specific tasks and data subsets to maintain a clear and concise data representation. Avoid using a single DTO for multiple payloads unless the data transferred is exactly the same. Create separate records for new or updated payloads.
5. Avoid Adding Methods: Refrain from adding methods to DTOs. They should only serve as simple data containers without any business logic.

Not utilizing DTOs can result in accidentally sending excessive data to clients, leading to unnecessary load on the underlying systems.
In the worst-case scenario, this might lead to the inadvertent exposure of sensitive data.
For instance, in a direct message chat, without employing DTOs, the following amount of information is transmitted via WebSocket for just one new message:

.. code-block:: json

                "deleted": false
            },
            "creationDate": "2023-07-24T02:43:54.791+02:00",

            "mainPage": "courses",
            "id": 31,
            "course": 2,
            "conversation": 31
        }
    }

Hence, entity objects must not be included in DTOs. This is a bad example for a DTO, since it contains the entity object ``Post``:

.. code-block:: java

    public record PostDTO(Post post, MetisCrudAction action) {}

This is a good example for a DTO, because it only contains very little information in the form of boxed primitive types and an enum value:

.. code-block:: java

    public record GradeDTO(String gradeName, Boolean isPassingGrade, GradeType gradeType) {}

13. Dependency injection
========================

* Some of you may argue with this, but by favoring constructor injection you can keep your business logic free from Spring. Not only is the @Autowired annotation optional on constructors, you also get the benefit of being able to easily instantiate your bean without Spring.
* Use setter based DI only for optional dependencies.
* Avoid circular dependencies, try constructor and setter based DI for such cases.

14. Keep it simple and stupid
=============================

* Don't write complex code.
* Don't write code when you are tired or in a bad mood.
* Optimization vs Readability: always write code that is simple to read and which will be understandable for developers. Because the time and resources spent on hard-to-read code cost much more than what we gain through optimization
* Commit messages should describe both what the commit changes and how it does it.
* ARCHITECTURE FIRST: writing code without thinking of the system's architecture is useless, in the same way as dreaming about your desires without a plan of achieving them.

15. File handling
=================

* Never use operating system (OS) specific file paths such as "test/test". Always use OS independent paths.
* Do not deal with File.separator manually. Instead use the Path.of(firstPart, secondPart, ...) method which deals with separators automatically.
* Existing paths can easily be appended with a new folder using ``existingPath.resolve(subfolder)``

16. General best practices
==========================

* Always use the least possible access level, prefer using private over public access modifier (package-private or protected can be used as well).
* Previously we used transactions very randomly, now we want to avoid using ``Transactional``. Transactions can kill performance, introduce locking issues and database concurrency problems, and add complexity to our application. Good read: https://codete.com/blog/5-common-spring-transactional-pitfalls/
* Define a constant if the same value is used more than once. Constants allow you to change code later a lot easier. Instead of looking for the places where this variable was used, you only need to change it in only one place.
* Facilitate code reuse. Always move duplicated code to reusable methods. IntelliJ is very good at suggesting duplicated lines and even automatically extracting them. Also don't be shy to use Generics.
* Always qualify a static class member reference with its class name and not with a reference or expression of that class's type.
* Prefer using primitive types to classes, e.g. ``long`` instead of ``Long``.
* Use ``./gradlew spotlessCheck`` and ``./gradlew spotlessApply`` to check Java code style and to automatically fix it.
* Don't use ``.collect(Collectors.toList())``. Instead use only ``.toList()`` for an unmodifiable list or ``.collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new))`` to explicitly create a new ArrayList.

17. Avoid service dependencies
==============================

In order to achieve low coupling and high cohesion, services should have as few dependencies on other services as possible:

* Avoid cyclic and redirectional dependencies
* Do not break the dependency cycle manually or by using `@Lazy`
* Move simple service methods into the repository as ``default`` methods

An example for a simple method is finding a single entity by ID:

.. code-block:: java

    default StudentExam findByIdElseThrow(Long studentExamId) throws EntityNotFoundException {
       return findById(studentExamId).orElseThrow(() -> new EntityNotFoundException("Student Exam", studentExamId));
    }


This approach has several benefits:

* Repositories don't have further dependencies (they are facades for the database), therefore there are no cycles
* We don't need to check for an ``EntityNotFoundException`` in the service since we throw in the repository already
* The "ElseThrow" suffix at the end of the method name makes the behaviour clear to outside callers

In general everything changing small database objects can go into the repository. More complex operations have to be done in the service.

Another approach is moving objects into the domain classes, but be aware that you need to add ``@JsonIgnore`` where necessary:

.. code-block:: java

    @JsonIgnore
    default boolean isLocked() {
        if (this instanceof ProgrammingExerciseStudentParticipation) {
            [...]
        }
        return false;
    }

18. Proper annotation of SQL query parameters
=============================================

Query parameters for SQL must be annotated with ``@Param("variable")``!

Do **not** write

.. code-block:: java

    @Query("""
            SELECT r
            FROM Result r
                LEFT JOIN FETCH r.feedbacks
            WHERE r.id = :resultId
            """)
    Optional<Result> findByIdWithEagerFeedbacks(Long resultId);

but instead annotate the parameter with @Param:

.. code-block:: java

    @Query("""
            SELECT r
            FROM Result r
                LEFT JOIN FETCH r.feedbacks
            WHERE r.id = :resultId
            """)
    Optional<Result> findByIdWithEagerFeedbacks(@Param("resultId") Long resultId);

The string name inside must match the name of the variable exactly!

19. SQL statement formatting
============================

We prefer to write SQL statements all in upper case. Split queries onto multiple lines using the Java Text Blocks notation (triple quotation mark):

.. code-block:: java

    @Query("""
            SELECT r
            FROM Result r
                LEFT JOIN FETCH r.feedbacks
            WHERE r.id = :resultId
            """)
    Optional<Result> findByIdWithEagerFeedbacks(@Param("resultId") Long resultId);

20. Avoid the usage of Sub-queries
==================================

SQL statements which do not contain sub-queries are preferable as they are more readable and have a better performance.
So instead of:

.. code-block:: java

    @Query("""
            SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT p)
            FROM StudentParticipation p
            WHERE p.exercise.id = :exerciseId
                AND EXISTS (SELECT s
                    FROM Submission s
                    WHERE s.participation.id = p.id
                        AND s.submitted = TRUE
                    )
            """)
    long countByExerciseIdSubmitted(@Param("exerciseId") long exerciseId);


you should use:

.. code-block:: java

    @Query("""
            SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT p)
            FROM StudentParticipation p
                JOIN p.submissions s
            WHERE p.exercise.id = :exerciseId
                AND s.submitted = TRUE
            """)
    long countByExerciseIdSubmitted(@Param("exerciseId") long exerciseId);

Functionally both queries extract the same result set, but the first one is less efficient as the sub-query is calculated for each StudentParticipation.

21. Criteria Builder
==================================================

For more details, please visit the :doc:`./criteria-builder` page.


22. REST endpoint best practices for authorization
==================================================

To reject unauthorized requests as early as possible, Artemis employs a two-step system:

#. ``PreAuthorize`` and ``Enforce`` annotations are responsible for blocking users with wrong or missing authorization roles without querying the database.
#. The ``AuthorizationCheckService`` is responsible for checking access rights to individual resources by querying the database.

Because the first method without database queries is substantially faster, always annotate your REST endpoints with the corresponding annotation. Always use the annotation for the minimum role that has access.
The following example makes the call only accessible to ADMIN and INSTRUCTOR users:

.. code-block:: java

    @EnforceAtLeastInstructor
    public ResponseEntity<ProgrammingExercise> getProgrammingExercise(@PathVariable long exerciseId) {
        var exercise = programmingExerciseRepository.findById(exerciseId);
        authCheckService.checkHasAtLeastRoleForExerciseElseThrow(Role.INSTRUCTOR, exercise, null);
        [...]
        return ResponseEntity.ok(programmingExerciseRepository.findById(exerciseId));
    }

Artemis distinguishes between six different roles: ADMIN, INSTRUCTOR, EDITOR, TA (teaching assistant), USER and ANONYMOUS.
Each of the roles has the all the access rights of the roles following it, e.g. ANONYMOUS has almost no rights, while ADMIN users can access every page.

The table contains all annotations for the corresponding minimum role including the required path prefix for all their endpoints and the package they should reside in. Different annotations get used during migration.

+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| **Minimum Role** | **Endpoint Annotation**                | **Path Prefix** | **Package**    |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| ADMIN            | @EnforceAdmin                          | /api/admin/     | web.rest.admin |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| INSTRUCTOR       | @EnforceAtLeastInstructor              | /api/           | web.rest       |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+

If, for some reason, you need to deviate from these rules, use ``@ManualConfig``. Use this annotation only if absolutely necessary as it will exclude the endpoint from the automatic authorization tests.

If a user passes the pre-authorization, the access to individual resources like courses and exercises still has to be checked. For example, a user can be a teaching assistant in one course, but only a student in another.
However, do not fetch the user from the database yourself (unless you need to re-use the user object), but only hand a role to the ``AuthorizationCheckService``:

.. code-block:: java

        // If we pass 'null' instead of a user here, the service will fetch the user object
        // and check if the user has at least the given role and access to the resource
        authCheckService.checkHasAtLeastRoleForExerciseElseThrow(Role.INSTRUCTOR, exercise, null);

To reduce duplication, do not add explicit checks for authorization or existence of an entity but always use the ``AuthorizationCheckService``:

.. code-block:: java

    @GetMapping(Endpoints.GET_FOR_COURSE)
    @EnforceAtLeastTutor
    public ResponseEntity<List<ProgrammingExercise>> getActiveProgrammingExercisesForCourse(@PathVariable Long courseId) {
        Course course = courseRepository.findByIdElseThrow(courseId);
        authCheckService.checkHasAtLeastRoleInCourseElseThrow(Role.TEACHING_ASSISTANT, course, null);

        List<ProgrammingExercise> exercises = programmingExerciseService.findActiveExercisesByCourseId(courseId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(exercises);
    }


The course repository call takes care of throwing a ``404 Not Found`` exception if there exists no matching course. The ``AuthorizationCheckService`` throws a ``403 Forbidden`` exception if the user with the given role is unauthorized. Afterwards delegate to a service or repository method. The code becomes much shorter, cleaner and more maintainable.


23. Assert using the most specific overload method
==================================================

When expecting results use ``assertThat`` for server tests. That call **must** be followed by another assertion statement like ``isTrue()``. It is best practice to use more specific assertion statement rather than always expecting boolean values.

For example, instead of

.. code-block:: java

    assertThat(submissionInDb.isPresent()).isTrue();
    assertThat(submissionInDb.get().getFilePath().contains("ffile.png")).isTrue();

use the methods from inside the ``assertThat`` directly:

.. code-block:: java

    assertThat(submissionInDb).isPresent();
    assertThat(submissionInDb.get().getFilePath()).contains("ffile.png");

This gives better error messages when an assertion fails and improves the code readability. However, be aware that not all methods can be used for assertions like this.

If you can't avoid using ``isTrue`` use the ``as`` keyword to add a custom error message:

.. code-block:: java

    assertThat(submission.isSubmittedInTime()).as("submission was not in time").isTrue();

Please read `the AssertJ documentation <https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-assertions-guide>`__, especially the `section about avoiding incorrect usage <https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-incorrect-usage>`__.

24. General Testing Tips
========================

Write meaningful comments for your tests.
These comments should contain information about what is tested specifically.

.. code-block:: java

    /**
     * Tests that borrow() in Book successfully sets the available attribute to false
     */
    @Test
    void testBorrowInBook() {
        // Test Code
    }

Use appropriate and descriptive names for test cases. This makes it easier for other developers to understand what you actually test without looking deeper into it.
This is the same reason why you should not name your variables int a, double b, String c, and so on. For example, if you want to test the method borrow in the class Book, testBorrowInBook() would be an appropriate name for the test case.

.. code-block:: java

    @Test
    void testBorrowInBook() {
        // Test Code
    }

Try to follow the best practices for Java testing:

* Write small and specific tests by heavily using helper functions, parameterized tests, AssertJ’s powerful assertions, not overusing variables, asserting only what’s relevant and avoiding one test for all corner cases.
* Write self-contained tests by revealing all relevant parameters, insert data right in the test and prefer composition over inheritance.
* Write dumb tests by avoiding the reuse of production code and focusing on comparing output values with hard-coded values.
* KISS > DRY ("Keep it simple, Stupid!" and "Don't repeat yourself!")
* Invest in a testable implementation by avoiding static access, using constructor injection, using Clocks and separating business logic from asynchronous execution.

25. Counting database query calls within tests
==============================================

It's possible to write tests that check how many database calls are performed during a REST call. This is useful to ensure that code changes don't lead to more database calls,
or at least to remind developers in case they do. It's especially important for commonly used endpoints that users access multiple times or every time they use Artemis.
However, we should consider carefully before adding such assertions to a test as it makes the test more tedious to maintain.

An example on how to track how many database calls are performed during a REST call is shown below. It uses the ``HibernateQueryInterceptor`` which counts the number of queries.
For ease of use, a custom assert ``assertThatDb`` was added that allows to do the check in one line. It also returns the original result of the REST call and so allows you to
add any other assertions to the test, as shown below.

.. code-block:: java

    class TestClass {

        @Test
        @WithMockUser(username = "instructor1", roles = "INSTRUCTOR")
        void testQueryCount() throws Exception {
            Course course = assertThatDb(() -> request.get("/api/courses/" + courses.get(0).getId() + "/for-dashboard", HttpStatus.OK, Course.class)).hasBeenCalledTimes(3);
            assertThat(course).isNotNull();
        }
    }

26. Avoid using @MockBean
=========================

Do not use the ``@SpyBean`` or ``@MockBean`` annotation unless absolutely necessary, or possibly in an abstract Superclass. If you want to see why in more detail, take a look `here <https://www.baeldung.com/spring-tests>`__.
Basically, every time ``@MockBean`` appears in a class, the ApplicationContext cache gets marked as dirty, hence the runner will clean the cache after the test-class is done and restarts the application context.
This leads to a large overhead, which tends to make the tests take a lot more time.

Here is an example how to replace a ``@SpyBean``. We wanted to test an edge case which is only executed if an ``IOException`` is thrown. We did this by mocking the service method and making it throw an Exception.

.. code-block:: java

    class TestExport extends AbstractSpringIntegrationBambooBitbucketJiraTest {
        @SpyBean
        private FileUploadSubmissionExportService fileUploadSubmissionExportService;

        @Test
        @WithMockUser(username = "instructor1", roles = "INSTRUCTOR")
        void testExportAll_IOException() throws Exception {
            doThrow(IOException.class).when(fileUploadSubmissionExportService).export(any(), any());
            request.postWithResponseBodyFile("/api/file-upload-export/" + fileUploadExercise.getId(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
        }
    }

As mentioned above, we should really avoid this.
Instead we can use `Static Mocks <https://asolntsev.github.io/en/2020/07/11/mockito-static-methods/>`_. When we look deeper in the ``export()`` method we find that there is a call of ``File.newOutputStream(..)``.
Now, instead of mocking the whole Service, we can just mock the static method, like this:

.. code-block:: java

    class TestExport extends AbstractSpringIntegrationBambooBitbucketJiraTest {
        // No beans used anymore
        @Test
        @WithMockUser(username = "instructor1", roles = "INSTRUCTOR")
        void testExportAll_IOException() throws Exception {
            MockedStatic<Files> mockedFiles = mockStatic(Files.class);
            mockedFiles.when(() -> Files.newOutputStream(any(), any())).thenThrow(IOException.class);
            request.postWithResponseBodyFile("/api/file-upload-export/" + fileUploadExercise.getId(), HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);

            mockedFiles.close();
        }
    }

You should notice here that we can avoid the use of a Bean and also test deeper. Instead of mocking the uppermost method we only throw the exception at the place where it could actually happen. Very important to mention is that you need to close the mock at the end of the test again.

For a real example where a SpyBean was replaced with a static mock look at the SubmissionExportIntegrationTest.java in `here <https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/4843137aa01cfdf27ea019400c48df00df36ed45>`__.
