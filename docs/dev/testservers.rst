Start the deployment by reviewing the `Build & Deploy` action.
(Refer to the `GitHub documentation "Reviewing deployments"`_.)
TS5 is locked to a pull request using the `lock:artemis-test5`_ label.
The workflow applies the lock label automatically on deployment.
Remove the label from the PR once the test server is free to use by other developers.
