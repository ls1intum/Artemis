# Programming Exercise

Conducting a programming exercise involves several steps shared between the **instructor**, **students**, and **Artemis**:

1. **Instructor prepares the exercise**: Set up a repository with starter code, tests, and build instructions.
2. **Student starts the exercise**: Artemis creates a personal repository and build plan.
3. *(Optional)* **Student clones the repository** to their IDE.
4. **Student solves the exercise** locally or in the online editor.
5. **Student submits the solution** by committing/pushing or clicking *Submit*.
6. **CI server verifies** the submission by running test cases and providing feedback.
7. **Student reviews results** and improves code if needed.
8. **Instructor reviews overall results** to detect common issues.

## Exercise Templates

Artemis supports a variety of programming exercise templates for automated feedback, static analysis, and repository setup.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Templates help maintain consistency across multiple programming exercises and programming languages.</p>
</Callout>

## Online Editor

The online code editor includes dynamic instructions and visual feedback:

- Tasks turn green when all related tests pass.
- UML elements and task blocks automatically update their colors after submission.
- Hidden files like `.gitignore` are not displayed.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>Hidden configuration files (e.g., <code>.swiftlint.yml</code>) are not visible in the online editor. Access them
        in your IDE if needed.</p>
</Callout>

## Manual Assessment

Instructors and tutors can assess programming submissions directly in the browser.

**Assessment features:**
- File browser with highlights for changed files.
- Build output logs for debugging failed builds.
- Read-only code editor with line-by-line feedback.
- Structured grading criteria displayed beside problem statements.

Feedback can be added inline or as general feedback at the bottom.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.success}>
    <p>You can save and reopen partial assessments before final submission. Once submitted, only instructors can edit
        them.</p>
</Callout>

## Testing with Ares

Ares is a JUnit 5 extension designed for **secure and robust Java testing**.

**Key features:**
- Sandbox execution (prevents test crashes and cheating)
- Time and I/O limits for stability
- Hidden and public test cases
- Improved error feedback for students

**Learn more:** [Ares on GitHub](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares)
