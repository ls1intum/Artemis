# Timeline of an Artemis Online Exam

<Image src={timeline} alt="Timeline of an Artemis Exam" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Timeline of an Artemis Online Exam" />

## 1. Creation and Configuration

During the exam creation and configuration, you can create your exam and configure it to fit your needs. Add exercises with different variants, register students, generate [student exams](#16-manage-student-exams) and conduct test runs. For more information see [Create and Configure Exam](#12-create-and-configure-exam).

### 1.1 Accessing the Exam Management Page

- Log in to Artemis with your account credentials.
- Click on <img src={courseManagement} alt="Course Management" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.
- Click on <img src={examsButton} alt="Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> for your course. It will open the *Exam Management Screen*.
- Here you have access to all the exams of your course. All aspects of the exam are managed from the management screen.
- You can create an exam by clicking on <img src={createNewExam} alt="Create New Exam" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.

### 1.2 Create and Configure Exam

#### 1.2.1 Exam Mode

- Artemis supports two exam modes. The conduction of normal exams and test exams.
- The normal exam mode is suitable for conducting end-of-semester exams. Students can view and work on the exam between the configured working time. Afterwards you can perform a manual or automated evaluation of the students' submissions. The results will be published on the specified date.
- Test exams provide you with the possibility to provide students with a practice opportunity for the end-of-semester exam. The main difference is that you choose a working window within which students can freely start the exam. Students then have the configured working time to complete the exam. After submitting, students immediately get the automated assessment for programming and quizzes. Manual correction of the submissions is not necessary.

#### 1.2.2 Create Exam

- When you click on <img src={createNewExam} alt="Create New Exam" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> you are presented with the *Create Exam* view. Here you can set the basic information such as `title`, `examiner` etc.
- You can choose between the exam and test exam mode.
- The [timeline of the exam](#) is defined by the dates: `visible from`, `start of working time`, `end of working time`, `release date of results`, `begin of student review`, `end of student review`.
- The first three dates are mandatory when you create an exam. The rest can be set when required.
- The `grace period` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the `working time` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default.
- Before the exam's assessment you can choose the `Number of correction rounds in exam`. If you want two tutors to assess a student's exam subsequently, set the number to two here. This enables the [second correction](#32-assessment-with-second-correction-round).
- You can also define the `number of exercises` in the exam. You can leave this out initially, however it must be set before you can generate the [student exams](#16-manage-student-exams). For more information, see [Exercise Groups](#13-exercise-groups).
- Artemis will randomize the order of the exercises for each student if you activate `randomize order of exercise groups`.
- Finally, you can fill out the exam `start text` and `end text`. Artemis will present these texts to the students during the [exam conduction](#2-conduction), at the *Start-* and *End* page respectively.

<Image src={examConduction} alt="Exam Conduction" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exam Conduction" />

<Image src={examExercises} alt="Exam Exercises" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exam Exercises" />

<Image src={examAssessment} alt="Exam Assessment and Student Review" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exam Assessment and Student Review" />

#### 1.2.3 Import Exam

- Instead of creating a new exam, you can import an existing exam by clicking on <img src={importExam} alt="Import Exam" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> from any of the courses you are an instructor in.
- Artemis displays a list of all available exams. To select one specific exam for the import, click on the <img src={importIndividualExam} alt="Import Individual Exam" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button.

<Image src={examImportSelection} alt="List with all exams available for import" size={ImageSize.large} caption="List with all exams available for import" />

- You are now presented with the *Import Exam* view. All information except for the dates are copied from the exam you selected for the import. You can find more information regarding this view at the section [create exam](#122-create-exam).
- Additionally, you can select or deselect exercises which are imported alongside the exam. You can find more information regarding the exercise import in the [section regarding the exercise group import](#131-import-exercise-groups).

### 1.3 Exercise Groups

- Artemis exam mode allows you to define multiple exercise variants so that each student can receive a unique exam. Artemis achieves this through exercise groups. Exercise groups represent an individual exercise slot for each [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams). Within one exercise group you can define different exercises.
- Artemis selects one exercise per exercise group randomly, to generate the individual [student exams](#16-manage-student-exams).
- You can distinguish between mandatory exercise groups and non-mandatory exercise groups.
- Artemis always includes mandatory exercise groups in the individual exam of a student.
- Non-mandatory exercise groups can be left out, if there are more exercise groups than the `number of exercises` defined in the [exam configuration](#12-create-and-configure-exam).
- By default, every exercise group is mandatory. You can set the `mandatory` flag when you add an exercise group initially, or later by clicking <img src={editButton} alt="Edit" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> on the exercise group.

<Image src={exerciseVariants} alt="Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants" />

#### 1.3.1 Import Exercise Groups

- Artemis exam mode allows you to import one or more exercise groups from an existing exam.
- The import process consists of two steps.

**Step 1: Select Exam**

- When you click on <img src={importExerciseGroup} alt="Import Exercise Group" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />, you can select one exam from which exercise group(s) should be imported.
- To select one exam, click on <img src={selectExerciseGroup} alt="Select Exercise Group" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.

<Image src={exerciseGroupImportExam} alt="First step in the process to import exercise group(s). You can select one exam, from which exercise group(s) should be imported" size={ImageSize.large} caption="First step in the process to import exercise group(s). You can select one exam, from which exercise group(s) should be imported" />

**Step 2: Select Exercises and Exercise Groups**

- In the next step you can select or deselect exercises which should be imported alongside the exercise groups.
- You can also change the `title` and `isMandatory` of an exercise group, as well as the `title` (and `short-name` for programming exercises) for the individual exercises.
- The title and short name of programming exercises must be unique. If you want to import an exercise group into the same course, you must change the title and short name before you can import the exercise group.
- After you have started the import by clicking on <img src={importExam} alt="Import Exam" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />, Artemis checks if the title and short name of the selected programming exercise(s) are unique. If they are not unique, a warning is displayed and you have to change the corresponding title and short name.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  - Further changes to the individual exercises can be made after the import by editing the respective exercise.
  - Programming exercises are imported using their initial configuration. This import functionality cannot be used for changing the submission policy, for activating / deactivating the static code analysis or for creating new build plans. In this case, please import the exercises individually into the exercise groups.
</Callout>

<Image src={exerciseGroupImportExercises} alt="Second step in the process to import exercise group(s). You can select or deselect individual exercises, which should be imported alongside the exercise group(s)." size={ImageSize.large} caption="Second step in the process to import exercise group(s). You can select or deselect individual exercises, which should be imported alongside the exercise group(s)." />

### 1.4 Add Exercises

- Exercise groups can contain multiple exercises. For every [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams), Artemis will randomly select one exercise per [exercise group](#13-exercise-groups).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you want all student to have the same exam, define only one exercise per [exercise group](#13-exercise-groups).
</Callout>

- To add exercises navigate to the *Exercise Groups* of the exam. On the header of each [exercise group](#13-exercise-groups) you will find the available exercise types. You can choose between `creating a new exercise` or `importing an existing one` from your courses.

<Image src={addExercises} alt="Add different Exercises" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Add different Exercises" />

- For exercise types `text` and `modeling` you can also define example submissions and example assessments to guide your assessor team.
- Assessors will review the example submissions and assessments in order to familiarise themselves with the exercise and assessment instructions, before they can assess the real submissions.

#### 1.4.1 Programming Exercises

- Programming exercises have multiple special options to adjust their behavior:

- You can check the option to `allow manual assessment`.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you do not set this flag, your assessors will not be able to manually assess the student's submissions during the [assessment process](#3-assessment).
</Callout>

- You can activate `Run Tests once after Due Date`. This will compile and run the test suite on all the student submissions once after the set date.
- After you add a programming exercise you can configure the grading via <img src={configureGradingButton} alt="Configure Grading Button" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.

- In the *Configure Grading* screen, you can tweak the `weight` of the tests, the `bonus multiplier` and add `bonus points`.
- You can hide tests so that they are not executed during the exam conduction by setting the test case visibility to `After Release Date of Results.` Students can not receive feedback from hidden tests during the exam conduction. This option is set by default when creating new programming exercises within an exam.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  When importing exercises, the test case visibility of imported exercise will equal the visibility of the original exercise. You can adjust the test case visibility in the import `Assessment` section to be set to `After Release Date of Results`.
</Callout>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you hide all tests, the students will only be able to see if their submission compiles during the conduction. Set the `Run Tests once after Due Date` after the exam end date to achieve this effect.
</Callout>

<Image src={configureGrading} alt="Configure the Grading of a Programming Exercise" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Configure the Grading of a Programming Exercise" />
    *Configure the Grading of a Programming Exercise*

- The *Configure Grading* screen also allows the configuration of submission policies.

### 1.5 Register Students

- To register students to the exam, navigate from the exam management to the *Students* page. Artemis offers two options to register students. You can:

1. Add students manually by searching via the search bar.
2. To import multiple students, click on the <img src={importStudents} alt="Import Students" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button and provide a `CSV` file in the Import Users dialog. The required fields in the `CSV` file include the `registrationNumber` and the `login`, while `email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `seat`, and `room` are optional. Note that the `room` and `seat` fields are only necessary for the exam participation check. You can find an example file at `docs/user/exams/instructor/example_import_students.csv`. To begin the import, press the <img src={importStudentsButton} alt="Import Students Button" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button.

<Image src={importStudentsDialog} alt="Import Students Dialog" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Import Students Dialog" />

3. Register every student in the course by pressing the <img src={registerCourseStudents} alt="Register Course Students" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Just registering the students to the exam will not allow them to participate in the exam. First, individual [student exams](#16-manage-student-exams) must be generated.
</Callout>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Artemis also supports validating participants signatures for on-site exams.
  For more information, please see [Exam Participation Checker](./participation-checker.mdx).
</Callout>

- You can also remove students from the exam. When you do so, you have the option to also delete their participations and submissions linked to the user's [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams).

<Image src={addStudents} alt="Register Students Page" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Register Students Page" />

### 1.6 Manage Student Exams

- Student exams represent the exam of a student. It consists of an individual set of exercises based on the configured [exercise groups](#13-exercise-groups).
- Student exams are managed via the *Student Exams* page.
- Here you can have an overview of all student exams. When you press `View` on a student exam, you can view the `details of the student`, the allocated `working time`, their `participation status`, their `summary`, as well as their `scores`. Additionally, you will also be able to view which assessor is responsible for each exercise.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  You can change the individual working time of students from here. The screenshot *Individual Working Time* below shows where you can do that.
</Callout>

- To generate student exams you must click on <img src={generateIndividualExams} alt="Generate Individual Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This will trigger Artemis to create a student exam for every registered user.
- Artemis determines the number of exercises from the [exam configuration](#12-create-and-configure-exam) and randomly selects one exercise per [exercise group](#13-exercise-groups).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  <img src={generateIndividualExams} alt="Generate Individual Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button will be locked once the exam becomes visible to the students. You cannot perform changes to student exams once the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) has started.
</Callout>

- If you have added more students recently, you can choose to <img src={generateMissingExams} alt="Generate Missing Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.
- <img src={prepareExerciseStart} alt="Prepare Exercise Start" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> creates a participation for each exercise for every registered user, based on their assigned exercises. It also creates the individual repositories and build plans for programming exercises. This action can take a while if there are many registered students due to the communication between the version control (VC) and continuous integration (CI) server.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
  You must trigger <img src={prepareExerciseStart} alt="Prepare Exercise Start" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> before the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) begins.
</Callout>

- On the *Student Exams* page, you can also maintain the repositories of student exams. This functionality only affects programming exercises. You can choose to <img src={lockRepo} alt="Lock Repo" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> and <img src={unlockRepo} alt="Unlock Repo" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> all student repositories.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Artemis locks and unlocks the student repositories automatically based on the individual exam start and end date. These buttons are typically not necessary unless something went wrong.
</Callout>

<Image src={studentExams} alt="Student Exam Page" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Student Exam Page" />

<Image src={individualWorkingTime} alt="Individual Working Time" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Individual Working Time" />

### 1.7 Conducting Test Runs

<Image src={testRunManagement} alt="Test Run Management" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Test Run Management" />

- Test runs are designed to offer the instructors confidence that the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) will run smoothly. They allow you to experience the exam from the student's perspective. A test run is distinct from a [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams) and is not taken into consideration during the calculation of the exam scores.
- You can manage your test runs from the *Test Run* page.
- To create a new test run you can press <img src={createTestRun} alt="Create Test Run" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This will open a popup where you can select an exercise for each [exercise group](#13-exercise-groups). You can also set the `working time`. A test run will have as many exercises as there are [exercise groups](#13-exercise-groups). It does consider the `number of exercises` set in the [exam configuration](#12-create-and-configure-exam).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Exercise groups with no exercises are ignored.
</Callout>

<Image src={createTestRunPopup} alt="Create test run popup with one exercise variant selected for each exercise group." size={ImageSize.large} caption="Create test run popup with one exercise variant selected for each exercise group." />

- When you start the test run, you conduct the exam similar to how a student would. You can create submissions for the different exercises and end the test run.
- An instructor can also assess his test run submissions. To do this, you must have completed at least one test run. To navigate to the assessment screen of the test runs click <img src={assessTestRuns} alt="Assess Test Runs" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.

<Image src={testRunConduction} alt="Test run conduction marked with the banner on the top left." size={ImageSize.large} caption="Test run conduction marked with the banner on the top left." />

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Only the creator of the test run is able to assess his submissions.
</Callout>

- You can view the results of the assessment of the test run by clicking on <img src={summaryButton} alt="Summary" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This page simulates the *Student Exam Summary* where the students can view their submissions and the results once they are published.
- Here instructors can also use the `complaint` feature and respond to it to conclude the full [exam timeline](#timeline-of-an-artemis-online-exam).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  You should delete test runs before the actual exam conduction takes place.
</Callout>

### 1.8 Exam Checklist

- After you create an exam, the exam checklist appears at the top of the exam's detail page.
- The exam checklist helps you oversee and ensure every step of the exam is executed correctly.
- You can track the progress of the steps mentioned in this document and spot missed steps easily.
- Each row of the checklist includes the name of the task, description and short summary where it is applicable and the page column which navigates the instructors to the relevant action.
- Going through each task from the start until the current task and making sure the description column contains no warnings or errors can help instructors conduct the exam smoothly.

<Image src={examChecklist} alt="In Progress Exam Checklist" size={ImageSize.large} caption="In Progress Exam Checklist" />

- The exam list page displays a more concise overview of the exam steps in the `Exam Status` column.
- You can glance over the preparation, conduction and correction status of the exams in the list.

<Image src={examChecklistOverview} alt="Exam Status Overview" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exam Status Overview" />

## 2. Conduction

The exam conduction starts when the exam becomes visible to the students and ends when the latest working time is over. When the exam conduction begins, you cannot change the [exam configuration](#12-create-and-configure-exam) or individual [student exams](#16-manage-student-exams). When the conduction starts, the students can access and start their exam. They can submit their solutions to the exercises within the given individual working time. After a student submits the exam, they cannot change their exercise submissions.

### Updating an Exercise during the Exam

In case you have to update the exercise during an exam for programming, modeling, text, or file-upload exercises, you can go to the exercise details page and click on <img src={editButton} alt="Edit" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> to edit the exercise. At the bottom of the exercise edit page, you can enter a notification text that is shown to the students in the exam mode. The screenshot below shows an example notification.

<Image src={exerciseNotification} alt="Field to enter a notification text" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Field to enter a notification text" />

## 3. Assessment

The assessment begins as soon as the latest [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams) working time is over.
During this period, your team can assess the submissions of the students and provide results.
Artemis executes the test suites for programming exercises automatically and grades these.
You can enhance the automatic grading with a manual review.
You can also trigger the automatic grading of the quiz exercises via the *Manage Student Exams Screen*.
If you want you can also enable the second correction feature for the exam.

### 3.1 Assess Student Exams

- Once the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) is over and the latest individual working time has passed, your team can begin the assessment process.
- This is done through the *Assessment Dashboard*.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) is not over, you will not be able to access this page.
</Callout>

- The assessment process is anonymized. Artemis omits personal student data from the assessors.
- The *Assessment Dashboard* provides an overview over the current assessment progress per exercise. For each exercise, you can view how many submissions have already been assessed and how many are still left. The status of the student complaints is also displayed here.

- Additionally, once the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) ends, you can click on <img src={evaluateQuizzes} alt="Evaluate Quizzes" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This action will evaluate all student exam submissions for all quiz exercises and assign an automatic result.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you do not press this button, the students quiz exercises will not be graded.
</Callout>

- After the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) ends, you can click on <img src={assessUnsubmittedStudentExams} alt="Assess Unsubmitted Student Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This action will automatically evaluate all submissions with 0 points for unsubmitted student exams. Additionally, empty submissions will be automatically graded with 0 points.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you do not press this button, the unsubmitted student submissions and the empty submissions will appear in the assessment dashboard of the exam, which leads to unnecessary effort during grading.
</Callout>

<Image src={assessmentDashboard} alt="Assessment Dashboard" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Assessment Dashboard" />

- To assess a submission for an exercise, you can click on <img src={exerciseDashboard} alt="Exercise Dashboard" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.
- Your assessors must first complete the example submissions and assessments, if you have attached those to the exercise, see [Add Exercises](#14-add-exercises).
- If there is a submission which has not been assessed yet, you can click <img src={startNewAssessment} alt="Start New Assessment" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This will fetch a random student submission of this exercise which you can then assess.
- Artemis grades programming exercises automatically. However, if the exercise allows a manual assessment, you can review and enhance the automatic results.
- You can trigger Artemis to automatically grade quiz exercises via the *Manage Student Exams Screen*. Therefore, quiz exercises do not appear in the *Assessment Dashboard*.

<Image src={programmingAssessment} alt="Manually Assessing a Programming Submission" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Manually Assessing a Programming Submission" />

### 3.2 Assessment with Second Correction Round

- Set the number of correction rounds of the exam to 2.

<Image src={setSecondCorrectionExam} alt="Configure exam" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Configure exam" />

- When the second correction is enabled, the assessment progress can be observed in the Assessment Dashboard.
- There you can see the state of the individual correction rounds, and the state of the complaints.

<Image src={secondCorrectionStatus} alt="second correction status" size={ImageSize.large} caption="second correction status" />

- You can toggle if tutors can assess specific exercises in the second round. Disabling the second correction again, does not affect already created second assessments.
- Correction in the second round can be enabled/disabled anytime.

<Image src={examAssessmentDashboardSecondCorrection} alt="Configure exam" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Configure exam" />

- To assess a submission a second time go to the exercise assessment dashboard. When it is enabled, a <img src={startNewAssessment} alt="Start New Assessment" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button will be visible in the second correction round.
- The new second assessment will have all the feedback copied from the first assessment. Those can be overridden, and new feedback can be added as well. This does not override the original result, but saves a separate second result.
- Within the second correction round review instructors and tutors can highlight which feedback was created for which correction round. This is displayed as a badge at the bottom of every feedback. This view can be enabled or disabled any time during the second correction round review by pressing the button at the top of the page. The feature is currently available for text, modeling and file-upload exercises.
- You can access each assessment of both rounds by going to the exam's <img src={exerciseGroupsButton} alt="Exercise Groups" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> -> <img src={scoresButton} alt="Scores" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> of the respective exercise.

The dashboard allows to detect exam sessions that fulfill certain criteria and gives an overview of the plagiarism detection.
An exam session is a unique combination of IP address, user agent, instance id, a session token and the browser fingerprint. It is created whenever a student enters their exam.
You can see the available analysis options in the first screenshot below. To start the analysis, click the <img src={analyzeSessions} alt="Analyze Sessions" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button. When the analysis detects at least one suspicious case, the instructor can click the <img src={viewSessions} alt="View Sessions" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button to see the details of the suspicious exam sessions.
The second screenshot shows an example of analysis results.

<Image src={suspiciousBehaviorAnalysisResults} alt="Suspicious Behavior Analysis Results Example" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Suspicious Behavior Analysis Results Example" />

In the lower half of the dashboard the instructor can view the plagiarism detection overview. It only lists exercises that support plagiarism detection. The number of potential plagiarism results are the results returned when running the detection. The number of plagiarism results are the cases a instructor has classified and confirmed as plagiarism.
To view the current detection results or run a detection click on the <img src={viewPlagiarismResults} alt="View Plagiarism Results" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button. This navigates to the plagiarism detection page of the exercise.
Once the instructor has confirmed at least one case, the <img src={viewCases} alt="View Cases" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button is visible at the bottom left of the table that navigates to all confirmed plagiarism cases of the exam.

<Image src={plagiarismCaseOverview} alt="Plagiarism Cases Overview" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Plagiarism Cases Overview" />

### 3.4 Plagiarism detection

- Artemis also allows you to detect plagiarism attempts.
- Artemis conducts this by analyzing the similarities between all student submissions and flagging those which exceed a given threshold. You can compare all flagged submissions side by side and confirm plagiarism attempts.
- Instructors can download a `CSV` report of accepted and rejected plagiarism attempts for further processing on external systems.
- To apply the plagiarism check, you must navigate to the individual exercise. This can be done by navigating to:

<img src={examsButton} alt="Exams" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> -> <img src={exerciseGroupsButton} alt="Exercise Groups" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> -> exercise-title

<Image src={plagiarism} alt="Detecting Plagiarism attempts on Modeling Exercises" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Detecting Plagiarism attempts on Modeling Exercises" />

- At the bottom of the page you will find the option <img src={checkPlagiarism} alt="Check Plagiarism" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />.

### 3.5 Exam Timeline

- Artemis stores the current state of a submission for text, modeling, and quiz exercises every 30s or whenever the student clicks the save button.
- As instructor, you have the possibility to view all those states as well as the submissions for file-upload or programming exercises using the exam timeline.
- The exam timeline is available on the details page of a student exam when the student exam has been submitted by clicking on the button <img src={examTimelineButton} alt="Exam Timeline" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. If the exam has not been submitted yet, the exam timeline button is disabled and shows an explanatory tooltip.
- The exam timeline shows all submissions of the student in chronological order. You can navigate between the different timestamps on the slider or navigate between different exercises using the navigation bar below the timeline
- For programming exercises, you can view a git diff between the currently selected submission and the previous submission or the template of this exercise.

### 3.6 Grading Key

- Optionally, you can create a grading key for your exam by clicking <img src={gradeKeyButton} alt="Grade Key" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> at the top of the exam's detail page.
- Defining a grading key allows the exam score to be converted to a grade automatically by Artemis, students are then able to see their own grades after the specified `Release Date of Results`.
- Using a grading key also enhances the generated statistics so that the instructor is able to view grade distributions.
- For an easy out-of-the-box configuration, you can click <img src={generateDefaultGradeKey} alt="Generate Default Grade Key" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> and then click `Save`.
- By default, grades are defined as percentages of the total obtainable score. You can also display their point equivalent if you specify `Maximum number of points for exam`.
- If you would like to define custom grade steps, you can use the <img src={addGradeStep} alt="Add Grade Step" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> button and modify the grade step intervals.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Keep an eye out for the warnings at the bottom of the page to ensure that the grading key is valid.
</Callout>

- `Inclusivity` field allows you to decide which grade should be assigned if the student's score is exactly equal to a boundary value between two grades.
- There are two grade types you can use: `Grade` and `Bonus`. The `Grade` type allows you to set a final grade for the exam with custom grade step names, while the `Bonus` type allows you to assign bonus points to each grade step so they can contribute to the grade of another course or exam.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If the `Grade Type` is `Grade` you should set `First Passing Grade`.
</Callout>

- For more fine grained control, you can switch to `Detailed` editing mode and set grade step bounds manually.
- <img src={importExportButton} alt="Import Export" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} /> buttons enable you to save the grading key as a CSV file and re-use it in other courses and exams.

<Image src={gradeKeyEditor} alt="Default Grading Key" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Default Grading Key" />

## 4. Publication of Results

You can specify the moment when Artemis publishes the results of the exam, see [Create Exam](#122-create-exam). This is usually when the assessment ends, but you can specify this at any point in time. During the publication of the results, the student can view their results from their summary page. You can also view the exam statistics from the exam *Scores* page and export the data into external platforms such as [TUM Online](https://campus.tum.de) as a `CSV` file, see [Exam Scores](#41-exam-scores).

### 4.1 Exam Scores

- You can access the exam scores by clicking on <img src={scoresButton} alt="Scores" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This view aggregates the results of the students and combines them to provide an overview over the students' performance.
- You can view the spread between different achieved scores, the average results per exercise, as well as the individual students' results.
- Additionally, you can choose to modify the dataset by selecting `only include submitted exams` or `only include exercises with at least one non-empty submission`.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  Unsubmitted exams are not eligible for the assessment process.
</Callout>

- Review student performance using various metrics such as average, median and standard deviation.
- Unsubmitted exams are not eligible for assessment and thereby appear as having no score. The corresponding students are assigned with a no-participation special grade if a grading key exists. It can happen that an exercise is not part of any [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams). This is the case when Artemis selects a different exercise of the same exercise group for every [student exam](#16-manage-student-exams). Similarly to the unsubmitted exams, they can warp the results and statistics of the exam. By eliminating unsubmitted exams and exercises which were not part of the [exam conduction](#2-conduction), you can gain a more realistic overview of the performance of the students.
- Review the students perceived difficulty of every exercise to improve exams in the future.
- The exam scores can also be exported via <img src={exportButton} alt="Export" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />. This is useful to upload the results into university systems like [TUM Online](https://campus.tum.de) as a `CSV` file.

- The exported `CSV` file includes the students' `name`, `username`, `email`, `registration number`, their assigned `exercises`, their `score` for every exercise, `overall exam points`, `overall exam score`, `grades` (before bonus if bonus is configured), `presentation score`, `submitted` (yes/no) and `passed` (yes/no) values.

- If bonus is configured, the file also contains `bonus grades` and `final grade`.
- If there is at least one plagiarism verdict in the exam, the file also contains `plagiarism verdicts`.
- If there is at least one plagiarism verdict in the bonus source, the file also contains `plagiarism verdicts in bonus course/exam`.
- The exported `CSV` file also contains the aggregated statistics of the [exam conduction](#2-conduction) such as the `number of participations` and the `average score` per exercise.

<Image src={examStatistics} alt="Exam Scores Page" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Exam Scores Page" />

### 4.2. Exam Solutions

Optionally, you can publish the example solutions of text, modeling, file upload and programming exercises to students with submissions after a desired date by setting `Example Solution Publication Date` of the exam to a non-empty date.
All example solutions of these exercises are published according to this date set in the exam, as opposed to the course exercises which have their own individual example solution publication dates.

- Example solution publication date can be empty, in this case solutions are never published. This is the default value.
- If set, example solution publication date must be the same or after the `visible from` and `end of working time` if they are set.

<Image src={examExampleSolutionPublicationDate} alt="Example Solution Publication Date" size={ImageSize.large} caption="Example Solution Publication Date" />

## 5. Student Review

During the review period, students have the opportunity to review the assessment of their exam. If they find inconsistencies, they can submit complaints about perceived mistakes made in the assessment. Students can provide their reasoning through a text message to clarify their objections. You can set the student review period in the [exam configuration](#12-create-and-configure-exam), see [Create Exam](#122-create-exam).

- Students can submit complaints about their assessment in the *Summary* page.
- During the student review, a complaint button will appear for every manually assessed exercise.
- Students cannot submit complaints for automatically assessed exercises like quiz and programming exercises.
- Students will be able to submit a complaint for programming exercises, if the automatic result has been reviewed manually by an assessor. This is only possible if manual assessment is enabled for the programming exercise.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  If you have found a mistake in the automatic assessment of quiz and programming exercises, you can edit those and re-trigger the evaluation for all participants.
</Callout>

## 6. Complaint Assessment

Artemis collects the complaints submitted by the students during the student review. You can access and review the complaints similar to the submissions from the *Assessment Dashboard*. Every assessor can evaluate a complaint about the assessment of their peers and either accept or reject the complaint. Artemis will automatically update the results of accepted complaints. You can view the updated scores immediately in the *Scores* page. There you can also export the updated data in `CSV` format, see [Exam Scores](#41-exam-scores).

- The complaints appear below the exercise submissions.
- The original assessor of an assessment cannot respond to the complaint. A second assessor must review the complaint and respond to it.
- Artemis tracks the progress of the complaint assessment and displays a progress bar in the *Assessment Dashboard*. This allows you to keep track of the complaint assessment and see how many open complaints are left.
