# LTI Configuration

## Overview

LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) is a standard developed by <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1EdTech</a>, allowing different learning platforms and tools to work together seamlessly.
It establishes a standard way of integrating learning applications, called tools (delivered by tool providers, e.g., Artemis), with platforms such as Learning Management Systems (e.g., Moodle, edX), called tool consumers.
Artemis is up-to-date with the latest in this standard, supporting <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3">LTI 1.3.</a>, ensuring a smooth and efficient connection between Artemis and educational platforms.

LTI 1.3 sets the foundation for securely launching and using educational tools within any LMS. It specifies the technical protocol for how tools like Artemis can seamlessly integrate into platforms like Moodle or edX.
When LTI 1.3 is combined with three critical services—Assignment and Grade Services, Names and Role Provisioning Services, and Deep Linking, it is collectively known as LTI Advantage.
This package provides a more comprehensive integration, allowing smoother communication between the educational tool and the LMS. For more detailed information about LTI Advantage and its features, visit <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview">1EdTech LTI Advantage</a>.
In the context of LTI Advantage, the term *Tool* refers to any external service or application that adds functionality to the learning environment, such as a tool for submitting exercises. On the other hand, *Platform* refers to the learning management system itself, which wants to incorporate these external tools.
In addition to supporting the core functionalities of LTI 1.3, Artemis integrates specific services under the LTI Advantage framework, including the Score Service from the LTI Advantage Assignment and Grade Services and the Deep Linking Service.

This is a comprehensive guide for instructors and administrators on setting up LTI integration between Artemis and their preferred LMS platforms.
We provide a general overview of the steps required to configure Artemis and specific guidance for popular platforms like Moodle and edX.
Additionally, we outline the capabilities available to different user roles within Artemis about LTI:

* **Administrators** can manage and configure LTI settings across the platform.
* **Instructors** can create and link Artemis content within their LMS courses.
* **Students** benefit from seamless access to Artemis features and course materials.

## Enabling Online Course

> **Note**
> The steps provided in this section assume the existence of an Artemis course and relevant content.
> For detailed information on the types of exercises Artemis supports and guidance on creating these exercises, please refer to the <a href="https://ls1intum.github.io/Artemis/instructor/exercises/">exercises-general-information</a>.
> This resource will help you understand the exercises Artemis can support and provide step-by-step instructions for creating and managing them within your course.

Before diving into the LTI configuration, ensuring that the Online Course setting is enabled in Artemis is crucial. This setting activates the LTI configurability, allowing instructors to link Artemis content with the LMS platforms.
As an instructor to enable the Online Course setting in Artemis, follow the steps below:\

1. As an instructor, locate and click on the <Image src={courseManagementImg} alt={"course-management"} size={ImageSize.small} /> option.
2. From the list of available courses, navigate to the course you wish to configure for LTI integration.
3. You will find an <Image src={courseSettingsButtonImg} alt={"course_settings_button"} size={ImageSize.small} /> button at the bottom of the sidebar to the left of the course overview page. Clicking this will allow you to modify various course settings.
4. As you scroll through the course settings, you will find an *Online Course* checkbox. This particular setting is essential for enabling LTI configurability.
5. To finalize the process, check the *Online Course* checkbox. You are activating the LTI configuration settings for that specific course. Make sure to save any changes made.

<Image src={enableOnlineCourseImg} alt={"Enable Online Course"} size={ImageSize.large} />

With the Online Course setting enabled, you can now integrate Artemis with LMSs using the LTI 1.3 standard. The subsequent sections of this guide will provide detailed steps for achieving this integration.

## Register Artemis with the platform

LTI 1.3 and LTI Advantage services use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect as security models. The Tool and the Platform need to register with each other ahead of time so that the platform can access Artemis course content.
Based on the platform-side implementation, registration may only need to happen once when the tool and platform are linked. Registration is a security agreement between the two systems.

There are a few different ways to register:

1. Dynamic registration: The exchange of relevant URLs and IDs is automatic. The platform initiates this process using the tool's registration URL.
2. Manual registration: A platform administrator must manually exchange URLs and IDs with the tool.

Dynamic registration makes it much easier for administrators to set up, so administrators should use it whenever possible, as long as the platform supports it.
It is best to use manual registration when the platform doesn't yet support dynamic registration because it will work on all LTI Advantage-compliant platforms.

### Dynamic Registration

If the soon-to-be-configured platform supports dynamic registration service, the only URL we need to provide to the platform is the Dynamic Registration URL.
To retrieve the Dynamic Registration URL from Artemis, follow the steps outlined below:

1. As an administrator user, go to *Server administration > LTI Configuration*
2. Once inside the LTI 1.3 Configuration of the server, you will see the *Platform Registration* tab.
3. You will find an option labeled *Dynamic Registration URL* within the Platform Registration tab. Copy this URL and provide it to your platform admin for further configuration.

<Image src={serverLtiConfigurationImg} alt={"Server LTI 1.3 Configuration"} size={ImageSize.large} />

The exact steps of using a registration URL to register Artemis as a tool are platform-dependent. We provide steps to configure Artemis into Moodle via Dynamic Registration URL in <a href="#dynamically-register-artemis-and-moodle">Dynamically Register Artemis and Moodle</a>.

> **Warning**
> LMS administrators must also possess administrative privileges on the Artemis site to effectively utilize the Dynamic Registration Service.
> Please get in touch with your Artemis administrator, providing your full name and email address, to ensure successful completion of this step.

#### Dynamically Register Artemis and Moodle

With the Dynamic Registration URL provided by the Artemis administrator, Moodle Admins can configure the LTI 1.3 integration in Moodle:
Please note that Moodle admins also need admin privileges on the Artemis site.

1. As an admin user, go to *Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > External tool > Manage tools*. This selection will lead you to the LTI configurations in Moodle.

<Image src={moodleSiteAdministrationImg} alt={"Moodle - Site Administration"} size={ImageSize.large} />

2. In the Manage Tools section, you will find the Tool URL field. Paste the Dynamic Registration URL provided into this field.
3. After entering the URL, click the *Add LTI Advantage* button. This action will begin integrating Artemis with Moodle using the LTI 1.3 standard.

<Image src={moodleAddToolUrlImg} alt={"Moodle - Site Administration"} size={ImageSize.large} />

4. If prompted, choose *Register as a new external tool*. The platform will only prompt you if another Artemis tool from the same domain is already configured.
5. After the page reloads, the tool card will be visible. To finalize the integration, click the *Activate* button. This action will complete the LTI 1.3 integration between Artemis and Moodle.

<Image src={moodleActivateLtiImg} alt={"Moodle - Activate Configuration"} size={ImageSize.medium} />

6. View configuration details of the tool card.
7. Find the *Tool configuration usage* field and select *Show in activity chooser and as a preconfigured tool*
8. Click on *Show more...* link to see further configuration settings. Set *Secure icon URL* field to Artemis icon URL.
9. Save the recent changes.

## Linking Artemis Content

Artemis supports various methods for integrating LTI platforms, enhancing the platform's versatility in connecting with external learning resources. A preferred method for setting up content links in Artemis is deep linking (also known as content selection).
This approach streamlines the integration process, allowing for a seamless connection between Artemis and external platforms. For situations where Deep Linking is not enabled, manual configuration of content links within external platforms is also possible.
Below, we explain both methods to assist instructors in choosing the best approach for their needs.

### Link creation via Deep Linking

> **Warning**
> The following process, recommended for instructors, assumes completion of the tool-platform registration.
> Deep Linking launches require an existing instructor role account in Artemis. Platform users without an account in Artemis cannot use this feature.

#### Deep Linking for Moodle

1. As a Moodle course instructor, navigate to the relevant course
2. Activate the *Edit Mode* in the top right corner.
3. Select *Add an activity or resource* under the relevant topic.
4. Select the pre-configured Artemis tool from the activity chooser.
5. If it does not exist, select External Tool, then select a pre-configured tool from the dropdown list.
6. Click the *Select content* button
7. Artemis will navigate you to the login page to log in using your instructor account.
8. Select the Artemis course to which you have access.

### Manual Link Creation

The following process guides instructors on linking exercises and lectures, assuming they have already completed the tool-platform registration.
The process involves two primary steps:

1. Retrieving the LTI 1.3 Launch URL for the desired Artemis exercise or lecture.
2. Linking this URL to the platform course. We will separately explain how to link exercise and lecture links to Moodle and edX.

#### Retrieve LTI 1.3 Launch URL from Artemis

1. As an instructor, navigate to the <Image src={courseManagementImg} alt={"course-management"} size={ImageSize.small} /> to view all your courses.
2. Select the one online course containing the exercise or lecture you would like to link to the platform from the list of available courses.

## Common Issues

### Issue: No Configuration Card Appears After Dynamic Registration in Moodle

As a Moodle administrator, verifying your permissions is essential if you initiate the dynamic registration process with Artemis and find that no configuration card appears.
Please get in touch with your Artemis administrator to ensure you have the privileges to successfully conduct dynamic registration.

### Issue: Blank Page on Exercise Launch in edX

When instructors or students attempt to launch an Artemis exercise from edX and encounter a blank page, it typically indicates a configuration issue with the LTI provider settings within edX. To resolve this, edX super administrators must ensure the Artemis platform is correctly configured as an LTI provider for the affected course and any relevant LTI blocks.

Resolution Steps:

1. As edX super administrators navigate to the Studio Administration panel.
2. Within the Studio Administration, locate the option to change the course's live configuration settings.
3. Select *Add Course Live Configuration*.
4. Fill Course Key, LTI Configuration.
5. Fill in the LTI provider as the Artemis platform's link. This step ensures that edX recognizes Artemis as a trusted source for launching external exercises.
6. For the course and each LTI block where the issue is observed, add a new LTI provider configuration.
