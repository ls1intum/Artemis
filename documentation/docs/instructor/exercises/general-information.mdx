# General Information

## Overview

Artemis offers different exercise types that have these things in common:

- **Release Date:** The date at which the exercise is released to the students. When an exercise does not have a release date, it is shown to the students immediately.
- **Due Date:** The date until the students can submit their solution.
- **Assessment Due Date:** The date until the tutors should finish the assessment of the student submissions. All assessments prior to this date will be released on the assessment due date.
- **Points:** You can achieve points in each exercise. Depending on the exercise configuration these points are not included in the course score, count towards the course score or are used as bonus points.

## Exercise Organization and Navigation

Users can reach the exercise overview by clicking on the tab labeled *Exercises*.

The exercise overview provides an organized view of all course exercises. The sidebar displays exercises categorized by time periods to help students navigate course content efficiently:

- **Future:** Upcoming exercises that haven't been released yet (start date is in the future)
- **Due Soon:** Exercises that are currently active and due within the next 3 days
- **Current:** Exercises that are currently available for participation (released but not due within 3 days)
- **Past:** Completed exercises that are no longer available for submission (due date has passed)
- **No Date:** Exercises without specific dates assigned

When a section (e.g., No date) contains more than 5 exercises, Artemis may create weekly subsections to improve navigation, though the exact grouping depends on exercise dates and distribution across weeks.
