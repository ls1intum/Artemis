# Assessment and Grading

## Overview

Artemis offers three different modes of exercise assessment:

- **Manual:** Reviewers must manually grade student submissions.
- **Automatic:** Artemis automatically grades student submissions (e.g., via test cases for programming exercises or answer checking for quizzes).
- **Semi-Automatic:** Artemis provides an automatic starting point that reviewers can manually improve afterward.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Manual assessment is available for programming, text, modeling, and file upload exercises. Quiz exercises use automatic assessment only.</p>
</Callout>


## Manual Assessment Process

Manual assessment involves the following workflow:

1. **Submission:** Students submit their assignments through Artemis.
2. **Review:** Reviewers access submitted work and place a **lock** on the submission to prevent conflicts with other reviewers.
3. **Evaluation:** Reviewers assign scores and provide feedback based on established grading criteria.
4. **Submission:** Reviewers submit their assessment (or cancel to unlock for others).
5. **Student Feedback:** Students can [rate feedback quality](/student/assessment#rating-feedback-quality), motivating high-quality assessments that helps students understand misconceptions and how to improve.


## Assessment Dashboard

The assessment dashboard provides an overview of assessment progress across all manually assessed exercises in a course.
The assessment dashboard helps to track the assessment progress for each exercise.
You can find the assessment dashboard via the **Assessment** button in the course management tab.

<Image src={assessmentDashboardButtonImg} alt={"Assessment Dashboard Button"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

This will navigate you to the course-wide Assessment Dashboard.

<Image src={assessmentDashboardImg} alt={"Course-wide Assessment Dashboard"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

The course-wide Assessment Dashboard displays:
- Total number of submissions
- Number of assessed submissions
- Number of complaints and feedback requests
- Average student rating for each exercise

Each exercise has its own **Exercise Dashboard** accessible from this view, showing detailed information for that specific exercise.

<Image src={exerciseDashboardImg} alt={"Exercise Dashboard"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Locks on submissions automatically expire after 24 hours, but reviewers can also unlock manually if needed.</p>
</Callout>


## Structured Grading Criteria

Artemis supports **structured grading instructions** (comparable to grading rubrics) to ensure consistency, fairness and transparency in the grading process.

<Image src={gradingCriteriaImg} alt={"Grading Criteria in Assessment Interface"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

### Benefits

- **Consistency:** All reviewers follow the same criteria - predefined feedback and points are used from different reviewers
- **Speed:** Drag-and-drop feedback blocks with predefined points make it faster to provide feedback
- **Fairness:** Objective standards reduce bias
- **Transparency:** Students understand how their work is evaluated

Grading criteria include predefined feedback text and point values that can be quickly applied to submissions.


## Integrated Training Process

To ensure consistent assessments, Artemis provides an **integrated training process** for reviewers using example submissions and assessments.
Reviewers must complete all example submissions before assessing actual student submissions.
This training ensures reviewers understand grading standards and can provide feedback properly.

### Training Workflow

| Step                             | Description & Screenshot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Create Example Submission** | The instructor creates an example submission and selects an assessment mode:<br/>- **Read and Confirm:** Reviewers read and acknowledge understanding<br/>- **Assess Correctly:** Reviewers must assess the example correctly to proceed<br/><Image src={instructorExampleSubmissionImg} alt={"Example Submission Creation"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **2. Add Example Assessment**    | The instructor adds an example assessment showing the correct grading. Actual student submissions can be imported as examples to increase realism and reduce effort.<br/><Image src={instructorExampleAssessmentImg} alt={"Example Assessment"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                                              |
| **3. Reviewer Views Status**     | Reviewers see their training progress and exercise status throughout the process.<br/><Image src={reviewerExerciseStatusImg} alt={"Exercise Status for Reviewer"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                                                                                                                            |
| **4. Review Instructions**       | Reviewers read the grading instructions (problem statement, grading criteria, example solution) and confirm understanding.<br/><Image src={reviewerAssessmentInstructionsImg} alt={"Assessment Instructions"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                                                                                |
| **5a. Read and Confirm Mode**    | If the assessment mode is "Read and Confirm," reviewers read example submissions and assessments, then confirm they understand.<br/><Image src={reviewerReadConfirmImg} alt={"Read and Confirm Example"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                                                                                     |
| **5b. Assess Correctly Mode**    | If the assessment mode is "Assess Correctly," Artemis compares the reviewer's assessment with the instructor's example. If they don't match, feedback explains the differences.<br/><Image src={reviewerAssessCorrectlyImg} alt={"Assess Correctly Feedback"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                                |

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.tip}>
    <p>Using actual student submissions as training examples makes the training more realistic and reduces instructor workload.</p>
</Callout>

## Double-Blind Assessment

Manual assessment in Artemis is **double-blind**:

- Reviewers don't see student names during assessment
- Students don't see reviewer identities

This minimizes bias and increases assessment objectivity.


## Handling Complaints

After receiving an assessment, students can submit **complaints** if they believe the assessment needs revision _(if you've enabled this feature)_.

### Complaint Token System

- Instructors set a maximum number of complaints per student per course
- Each complaint uses one "token"
- If accepted, the token is returned to the student
- Students can submit unlimited complaints as long as their complaints are accepted

### Complaint Review Process

1. Student submits a complaint with justification
2. Reviewer accesses the complaint from the Exercise Dashboard
3. Reviewer re-evaluates the submission and decides:

| Decision   | Action & Screenshot                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accept** | Add or modify feedback blocks (positive or negative points) and click "Accept complaint"<br/><Image src={acceptComplaintImg} alt={"Accept Complaint"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **Reject** | Explain why the complaint is rejected and click "Reject complaint"<br/><Image src={rejectComplaintImg} alt={"Reject Complaint"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                       |
| **Unsure** | Remove the lock so another reviewer can evaluate<br/><Image src={lockImg} alt={"Unlock Complaint"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>                                                    |

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>Complaints can result in score increases or decreases based on the re-assessment. Be thorough and fair.</p>
</Callout>


## More Feedback Requests

Students can also submit **More Feedback Requests** to ask for clarification without disputing their score.
The review process is identical to handling complaints for reviewers.
Although, there are [differences for students](/student/assessment#more-feedback-requests).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>More feedback requests don't cost tokens, but reviewers <strong>cannot change the score</strong> when responding.</p>
</Callout>

## Grading Leaderboard

The **Grading Leaderboard** helps instructors monitor reviewer performance and motivate high-quality assessments.
The leaderboard is visible to all reviewers, creating transparency and encouraging consistent, fair grading.

<Image src={leaderboardImg} alt={"Grading Leaderboard"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

### Displayed Metrics

- Number of assessments completed by each reviewer
- Number of feedback requests received
- Number of accepted complaints about each reviewer
- Average score given by the reviewer
- Average rating received from students

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Artemis automatically detects "Issues with reviewer performance" when reviewers significantly deviate from the average, helping you identify potential problems early.</p>
</Callout>


## Automatic Assessment

Automatic assessment is available for:

- **Quiz Exercises:** Artemis automatically grades submissions after the due date (only mode available for quizzes). See the [Quiz Exercises](https://artemis-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/exercises/quiz.html#quiz) section for details.
- **Programming Exercises:** Instructor-written test cases run against student submissions, either during or after the due date. See the [Programming Exercises](https://artemis-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/exercises/programming.html#programming) guide for more information.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>You can enable complaints for automatically graded programming exercises, allowing students to dispute test results.</p>
</Callout>
