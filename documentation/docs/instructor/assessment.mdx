# Assessment and Grading

## Overview

Artemis offers three different modes of exercise assessment:

- **Manual:** Reviewers must manually grade student submissions.
- **Automatic:** Artemis automatically grades student submissions (e.g., via test cases for programming exercises or answer checking for quizzes).
- **Semi-Automatic:** Artemis provides an automatic starting point that reviewers can manually improve afterward.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Manual assessment is available for programming, text, modeling, and file upload exercises. Quiz exercises use automatic assessment only.</p>
</Callout>

---

## Manual Assessment Process

Manual assessment involves the following workflow:

1. **Submission:** Students submit their assignments through Artemis.
2. **Review:** Reviewers access submitted work and place a **lock** on the submission to prevent conflicts with other reviewers.
3. **Evaluation:** Reviewers assign scores and provide feedback based on established grading criteria.
4. **Submission:** Reviewers submit their assessment (or cancel to unlock for others).
5. **Student Feedback:** Students can rate feedback quality, motivating high-quality assessments.

---

## Assessment Dashboard

The assessment dashboard provides an overview of assessment progress across all exercises in a course.

<table>
<tr>
<td><Image src={assessmentDashboardButtonImg} alt={"Assessment Dashboard Button"} size={ImageSize.small} hideBorder={true}></Image></td>
<td><Image src={assessmentDashboardImg} alt={"Assessment Dashboard"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image></td>
</tr>
</table>

The dashboard displays:

- Exercise state (e.g., released, due date passed)
- Total number of submissions
- Number of assessed submissions
- Number of complaints and feedback requests
- Average student rating for each exercise

Each exercise has its own **Exercise Dashboard** accessible from this view, showing detailed information for that specific exercise.

<Image src={exerciseDashboardImg} alt={"Exercise Dashboard"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>Locks on submissions automatically expire after 24 hours, but reviewers can also unlock manually if needed.</p>
</Callout>

---

## Structured Grading Criteria

Artemis supports **structured grading instructions** (similar to grading rubrics) to ensure consistency, fairness, and transparency.

<Image src={gradingCriteriaImg} alt={"Grading Criteria in Assessment Interface"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

### Benefits

- **Consistency:** All reviewers follow the same criteria
- **Speed:** Drag-and-drop feedback blocks with predefined points
- **Transparency:** Students understand how their work is evaluated
- **Fairness:** Objective standards reduce bias

Grading criteria include predefined feedback text and point values that can be quickly applied to submissions.

---

## Integrated Training Process

To ensure consistent and high-quality assessments, Artemis provides an **integrated training process** for reviewers using example submissions and assessments.

### Training Workflow

| Step | Description | Screenshot |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Create Example Submission** | The instructor creates an example submission and selects an assessment mode:<br/>- **Read and Confirm:** Reviewers read and acknowledge understanding<br/>- **Assess Correctly:** Reviewers must assess the example correctly to proceed | <Image src={instructorExampleSubmissionImg} alt={"Example Submission Creation"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **2. Add Example Assessment** | The instructor adds an example assessment showing the correct grading. Actual student submissions can be imported as examples to increase realism and reduce effort. | <Image src={instructorExampleAssessmentImg} alt={"Example Assessment"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **3. Reviewer Views Status** | Reviewers see their training progress and exercise status throughout the process. | <Image src={reviewerExerciseStatusImg} alt={"Exercise Status for Reviewer"} size={ImageSize.small} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **4. Review Instructions** | Reviewers read the grading instructions (problem statement, grading criteria, example solution) and confirm understanding. | <Image src={reviewerAssessmentInstructionsImg} alt={"Assessment Instructions"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **5a. Read and Confirm Mode** | If the assessment mode is "Read and Confirm," reviewers read example submissions and assessments, then confirm they understand. | <Image src={reviewerReadConfirmImg} alt={"Read and Confirm Example"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **5b. Assess Correctly Mode** | If the assessment mode is "Assess Correctly," Artemis compares the reviewer's assessment with the instructor's example. If they don't match, feedback explains the differences. | <Image src={reviewerAssessCorrectlyImg} alt={"Assess Correctly Feedback"} size={ImageSize.medium} hideBorder={true}></Image> |

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.tip}>
    <p>Using actual student submissions as training examples makes the training more realistic and reduces instructor workload.</p>
</Callout>

## Double-Blind Grading

Manual assessment in Artemis is **double-blind**:

- Reviewers don't see student names during assessment
- Students don't see reviewer identities

This minimizes bias and increases assessment objectivity.

---

## Handling Complaints

After receiving a grade, students can submit **complaints** if they believe the assessment needs revision (if you've enabled this feature).

### Complaint Token System

- Instructors set a maximum number of complaints per student per course
- Each complaint uses one "token"
- If accepted, the token is returned to the student
- Students can submit unlimited complaints as long as they're accepted

### Complaint Review Process

1. Student submits a complaint with justification
2. Reviewer accesses the complaint from the Exercise Dashboard
3. Reviewer evaluates and decides:

| Decision | Action | Screenshot |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Accept** | Add or modify feedback blocks (positive or negative points) and click "Accept complaint" | <Image src={acceptComplaintImg} alt={"Accept Complaint"} size={ImageSize.small} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **Reject** | Explain why the complaint is rejected and click "Reject complaint" | <Image src={rejectComplaintImg} alt={"Reject Complaint"} size={ImageSize.small} hideBorder={true}></Image> |
| **Unsure** | Remove the lock so another reviewer can evaluate | <Image src={lockImg} alt={"Unlock Complaint"} size={ImageSize.small} hideBorder={true}></Image> |

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>Complaints can result in score increases or decreases based on the reassessment. Be thorough and fair.</p>
</Callout>

---

## More Feedback Requests

Students can also submit **More Feedback Requests** to ask for clarification without disputing their score.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>More feedback requests don't cost tokens, but reviewers <strong>cannot change the score</strong> when responding.</p>
</Callout>

The review process is identical to handling complaints, except:
- No token is consumed
- The score cannot be modified
- Students lose the ability to complain after requesting more feedback

---

## Grading Leaderboard

The **Grading Leaderboard** helps instructors monitor reviewer performance and motivate high-quality assessments.

<Image src={leaderboardImg} alt={"Grading Leaderboard"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

### Displayed Metrics

- Number of assessments completed by each reviewer
- Number of feedback requests received
- Number of accepted complaints
- Average score given by the reviewer
- Average rating received from students

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.tip}>
    <p>Artemis automatically detects "Issues with reviewer performance" when reviewers significantly deviate from the average, helping you identify potential problems early.</p>
</Callout>

The leaderboard is visible to all reviewers, creating transparency and encouraging consistent, fair grading.

---

## Automatic Assessment

Automatic assessment is available for:

- **Quiz Exercises:** Artemis automatically grades submissions after the due date (only mode available for quizzes). See the [Quiz Exercises](../student/quiz-training) section for details.
- **Programming Exercises:** Instructor-written test cases run against student submissions, either during or after the due date. See the [Programming Exercises](./programming) guide for more information.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>You can enable complaints for automatically graded programming exercises, allowing students to dispute test results.</p>
</Callout>
