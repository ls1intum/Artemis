# System Notifications

System notifications allow administrators to inform all users about important events such as planned maintenance windows. Notifications appear as banners in the Artemis UI for all connected users.

## Creating a System Notification

1. Navigate to **Administration > System Notifications**.
2. Click **Create a new system notification**.
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Title**: A short descriptive title (required, max 50 characters).
   - **Text**: Additional details about the notification.
   - **Type**: `INFO` or `WARNING` (determines the banner style).
   - **Notification Date**: When the banner should start appearing.
   - **Expiration Date**: When the banner should disappear (must be after the notification date).

## Maintenance Email Announcements

When creating a new system notification, administrators can optionally send an email to all instructors of ongoing courses:

1. Check the **Announce maintenance to all instructors via email** checkbox.
2. The form displays the number of instructors who will receive the email.
3. Upon saving, each instructor receives a localized email with the maintenance window details.

### Who receives the email?

- All users who belong to an **instructor group** of an **ongoing course** (a course whose start date is in the past or unset, and whose end date is in the future or unset).
- Users who have **not opted out** of maintenance notifications in their user settings.
- Only users with a valid email address.

### Opting out

Instructors can disable maintenance email notifications in **User Settings > Notifications** by toggling the **Planned Maintenance Announcements** option.
