# Course Management for Administrators

This guide covers administrative operations for course management, including course reset and course archiving functionality. These operations are only available to system administrators.

---

## Course Reset

The **Course Reset** operation allows administrators to clear all student data from a course while preserving the course structure. This is useful for:

- **Data privacy compliance** (e.g., GDPR) - removing student data after a semester ends
- **Reusing course templates** - preparing a course for a new cohort of students
- **Testing purposes** - resetting a test course to its initial state

:::warning
The course reset operation **cannot be undone**. Before performing a reset, consider archiving the course to preserve student data for future reference.

## Course Archive

The **Course Archive** operation creates a ZIP file containing course data for long-term storage. The archive is useful for:

- **Record keeping** - Maintaining evidence of student work and assessments
- **Compliance** - Meeting data retention requirements
- **Backup** - Preserving course data before deletion or reset

### Archive Contents

The course archive is structured as follows:

```

## Best Practices

### Before Resetting a Course

1. **Create an archive** - Always archive the course before resetting to preserve student data
2. **Notify stakeholders** - Inform instructors and relevant staff about the reset
3. **Verify the course** - Double-check you are resetting the correct course
4. **Check data retention policies** - Ensure you comply with institutional requirements

### After Archiving a Course

1. **Verify the archive** - Check the ZIP file can be extracted and contains expected data
2. **Store securely** - Move the archive to secure, backed-up storage
3. **Document location** - Record where the archive is stored for future reference
4. **Set retention period** - Note when the archive can be deleted per policy
