# Manage Standardized Competencies (Administrator)

## Standardized Competencies

| The **Standardized Competency Catalog** is a catalog of competencies that is accessible to all instructors in an Artemis instance.
Instructors may view this catalog and import competencies from it into their course.
| The competencies consist of a title, description and taxonomy. Instead of being tied to specific courses, competencies are organized under knowledge areas.
| Knowledge areas may also contain other knowledge areas, enabling a hierarchical structure (e.g., Artificial Intelligence -> Machine Learning).

        To use this feature, the <em>standardized competency feature toggle</em> needs to be enabled.

| Administrators can manage the standardized competency catalog of their Artemis instance
in the *Standardized Competency Management* view.

| They can filter the displayed content by competency title and knowledge area.
Clicking on a knowledge area expands it and clicking on the eye icon shows the knowledge area details on the right.
| From this details view they can edit or delete the knowledge area, or create new knowledge areas and competencies under it.
Likewise, clicking on a standardized competency opens its details, allowing administrators to edit or delete it.
| Finally, administrators can also import a standardized competency catalog from a JSON file,
or export the standardized competency catalog of their Artemis instance into a JSON file.

## Import a Standardized Competency Catalog

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    <p>
        To obtain a file containing a standardized competency catalog, you can contact the Artemis developer team.
    </p>
</Callout>

| When importing, administrators first view a collapsible example of the expected file structure.
They can then select a file containing standardized competencies from their local system.
| Artemis displays a preview of the knowledge areas and competencies that will be imported
and administrators can view the details for each competency by clicking on it.
| After clicking on import, the complete catalog will be imported into the Artemis instance.
