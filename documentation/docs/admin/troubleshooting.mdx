# Troubleshooting

## Repository download of large courses fails

The most likely issue is that the configured timeouts on the reverse proxy are too low.

If you set up your Artemis instance with the
<a href="https://github.com/ls1intum/artemis-ansible-collection">Ansible Role (>=v0.1.1)</a>,
you can set the timeout values with the following variables:

```yaml
proxy_send_timeout: "900s"
proxy_read_timeout: "900s"
fastcgi_send_timeout: "900s"
fastcgi_read_timeout: "900s"
```

If you configured the nginx reverse proxy by hand, you have to adapt the following variables in your nginx configurations:
- https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_read_timeout
- https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_send_timeout
