# Access Rights

Artemis distinguishes between seven different roles: **SUPER_ADMIN**, **ADMIN**, **INSTRUCTOR**, **EDITOR**, **TA** (Teaching Assistant), **USER** and **ANONYMOUS**.
The roles are sorted in descending order. An INSTRUCTOR has at least all the permissions that an EDITOR has.
A SUPER_ADMIN has no restrictions, while an ANONYMOUS has hardly any rights.

## Roles Overview

- **SUPER_ADMIN:** has all permissions that an ADMIN has and additional privileges for critical security operations (see [Super Admin vs Admin](#super-admin-vs-admin) for details)
- **ADMIN:** can access all features that Artemis provides (includes features regarding the server administration, e.g. server health checks, user management and creating new courses)
- **INSTRUCTOR:** can access all features related to the content of a course (includes creating and deleting exercises/exams/lectures and monitoring scores and submissions)
- **EDITOR:** can create and edit the content of a course but cannot delete content and monitoring other course participants is limited
- **TEACHING ASSISTANT:** can assess student submissions and view course content before the release date
- **USER:** participates as a Student in courses, can view course content after the release date
- **ANONYMOUS:** role before login

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    When changing the access rights of a user, the respective user must logoff and then logon again for the changes to take effect.
</Callout>

In the following, the respective permissions illustrated. If a subordinated role has all permissions or a role does not have any access rights, it is not explicitly displayed.

## Super Admin vs Admin

While Super Admins have all the permissions of regular Admins, they have additional privileges in security-critical areas:

### Passkey Approval

Super Admins have the exclusive privilege to approve passkey registrations for administrators. This minimizes the attack surface for critical security operations by limiting passkey approval to a very small number of trusted users.

For detailed information about passkey authentication, configuration, and the approval process, see the [Passkey Authentication](/admin/production-setup/security#passkey-authentication) section in the Security Configuration documentation.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    Super Admin privileges are only relevant when passkeys are activated and passkey enforcement for administrators is enabled. In other configurations, Super Admins and Admins have identical permissions.
