# Exams

Artemis includes an online exam mode that allows you to take exams directly in the platform.

## General Information

### Prerequisites

- **Stable internet connection**

  **Recommendation:** Use a LAN connection if possible.

- **Browser**

  **Recommendation:** Chromium (based), e.g. Google Chrome, newest version.

- The following prerequisites are only required if your exam contains Java programming exercises:

  - **Java IDE with JDK 17**

    **Recommendation:** IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2.5 or Eclipse IDE 2025-09.

  - **Git Client**

    **Recommendation:** Use the git client integrated into IntelliJ and Eclipse! (Alternative: SourceTree or GitKraken)

### Offline Mode

- The exam mode in Artemis tolerates issues with the Internet connection.
- If you lose your connection, you can continue working on text-, quiz- and modeling exercises, but you might get warnings that your solutions cannot be saved.
- If your Internet connection recovers, Artemis will save your solution.
- Artemis tries to save your solution every 30 seconds and whenever you navigate between exercises.
- Programming exercises have 2 modes.

  1. **Online code editor:** can only be used when you are online.
        <Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
            <p>You have to click on <img src={require('./assets/exams/buttons/submit.png').default} alt="Submit" style={{display: 'inline', verticalAlign: 'middle', height: '2rem'}} />! Otherwise your solution will <strong>not</strong> be pushed to the VC server and no build will be triggered.</p>
        </Callout>

  2. **Local IDE:** you only need to be online when you clone the repository and when you push your commits (i.e. submit your solution).

- At the end of the online exam, you must be online within a given `grace period` and submit your exam, otherwise it will not be graded.

### Suggestions

1. Do **NOT** reload the browser

   - If you reload the browser, the [Welcome Screen](#welcome-screen) screen opens and you must enter your name and confirm the checkbox again.
   - You should only reload if an error occurs that cannot be recovered otherwise!

2. Participate in **ONE** browser window and only one browser tab!

   - Working in multiple browser windows or tabs at the same time is **not** allowed! Having multiple Artemis windows or tabs open is ok, as long as only one of them accesses the exam.
   - It will lead to synchronization issues and is seen as suspicious behavior that can be flagged as cheating.

   ![Reload](./assets/exams/reload.png)
   *Do not reload, you will receive a warning*

### Participating in Programming Exercises

- Depending on your exam, programming exercises can come in three forms:

  1. Online Code Editor + support for local IDE
  2. Online Code Editor
  3. Support for local IDE

- If your exercise allows the use of the code editor your screen will be divided into three sections, from left to right:

  1. The file browser
  2. The code Editor
  3. The instructions

- The file browser displays the file structure of the assignment. You can access any file within the assignment. Artemis will display the selected file's content in the code editor where you can edit it.

  - You can add new files and directories using the ![Add File](./assets/exams/buttons/add_file.png) and ![Add Folder](./assets/exams/buttons/add_folder.png) buttons.
  - You also have the ability to rename ![Rename](./assets/exams/buttons/rename_file.png) and delete ![Delete](./assets/exams/buttons/delete_file.png) files and folders, therefore **caution** is advised.

- The code editor allows you to edit the content of specific files. It shows the line numbers and will also annotate the appropriate line, if a compilation error occurs.
- The instructions are docked to the right.
- If you want to focus only on the code editor, you can collapse the instructions by pressing on the ![Right Arrow](./assets/exams/buttons/right_arrow.png). This can be reverted by pressing the arrow again. Similarly, if you want to collapse the file browser, you can press the ![Left Arrow](./assets/exams/buttons/left_arrow.png) above the file browser.

  :::note
  You can also choose to resize any of the three sections by dragging the ![Outline Box](./assets/exams/buttons/outline_box.png).
  :::

- When you press ![Refresh Files](./assets/exams/buttons/refresh_files.png) all unsaved changes are overwritten in the online code editor. Your changes are auto-saved every 30 seconds by Artemis in the code editor.

- When you press ![Submit](./assets/exams/buttons/submit.png), your changes are pushed to the version control (VC) server and a build is started on the continuous integration (CI) server. This is indicated by the results changing from ![No Results Found](./assets/exams/buttons/exam_no_results_found.png) to ![Building and Testing](./assets/exams/buttons/building_and_testing.png). You need to first press ![Submit](./assets/exams/buttons/submit.png) to get feedback on your submissions build status.

  :::warning
  There is no auto-submit!
  :::

![Participating in Programming Exercises](./assets/exams/exam_programming_exercises.png)
*Participating in Programming Exercises with the online code editor and local IDE enabled*

- If your exercise allows the use of the local IDE, you can clone your repository using the ![Code](./assets/exams/buttons/code.png) button.
- When you click it you can choose to clone the exercise via `HTTPS` or `SSH`, if you have configured your private key.

  :::note
  You must link a public key to your account in advance if you want to use `SSH`.
  :::

- To work offline follow these steps:

  1. Clone the Exercise
  2. Import the project in your IDE
  3. Work on the code
  4. Commit and push the code. A push is equivalent to pressing the ![Submit](./assets/exams/buttons/submit.png) button.

![Clone Repository](./assets/exams/exam_clone_repository.png)
*Clone the Repository*

:::warning
You are responsible for pushing/submitting your code. Your instructors **cannot** help you if you did not submit.
:::

- Your instructors can decide to limit the real-time feedback in programming exercises during the online exam.
- In that case, you will only see if your code compiles or not:

  1. ![Build Failed](./assets/exams/buttons/build_failed.png) means that your code does **not** compile!
  2. ![Build Passed](./assets/exams/buttons/hidden.png) means that your code compiles but provides no further information about your final score.

  :::warning
  Edit a programming exercise **EITHER** in the online editor **OR** in your local IDE! Otherwise, conflicts can occur that are hard to resolve.
  :::

  If you work in the online code editor and a merge conflict occurs, the file browser will display the conflict state ![Conflict State](./assets/exams/conflict_state.png).
  You can use the ![Resolve Conflict](./assets/exams/buttons/resolve_conflict.png) button, which is then displayed instead of the submit button, to resolve the conflict within the online code editor.
  This will reset your changes to the latest commit.

  :::warning
  Manual merging is not possible with the online code editor.
  :::

### Updated Problem Statement during the Exam

If your instructor updates the problem statement for an exercise during the exam, you will receive a notification, as seen in the screenshot below, and can switch between a diff view and the new problem statement, as shown in the second and third screenshot.

![Problem Statement Update Notification](./assets/exams/student-notification.png)

![Updated Problem Statement in the Normal View](./assets/exams/problem-statement-normal-view.png)

![Updated Problem Statement in the Diff View](./assets/exams/problem-statement-diff-view.png)

- The instructors can set submission policies, defining the effect of your submissions on your participation. The policies and their effects are as follows:

  - **None** You can submit as many times as you want without any consequences.
  - **Lock Repository** There's a limit on the number of allowed submissions. Once you exceed the limit, your repository will be locked and further submissions will not be allowed.

    ![Effect of the Lock Repository Policy](./assets/exams/exam_submission_policy_lock.png)

  - **Submission Penalty** There's a limit on the number of allowed submissions. Once you exceed the limit, you will be penalized for each additional submission.

    ![Effect of the Submission Penalty Policy](./assets/exams/exam_submission_policy_penalty.png)

### End Screen

- When you are finished with the exercises, or the time runs out you navigate to the *End Screen*.
- This is done either by clicking on ![Hand in Early](./assets/exams/buttons/exam_hand_in_early.png) or automatically when the exam conduction time is over.

  :::note
  If you navigated to this screen via ![Hand in Early](./assets/exams/buttons/exam_hand_in_early.png), you have the option to return to the conduction by clicking on ![Continue](./assets/exams/buttons/continue.png).
  :::

- In this screen you should confirm that you followed all the rules and sign with your full name, similar to the [Welcome Screen](#welcome-screen).
- You are given an additional `grace period` to submit the exam after the conduction is over. This additional time is added to the timer shown on the top right.

  :::warning
  Your exam will not be graded, should you fail to submit!
  :::

- Once you submit your exam, no further changes can be made to any exercise.

![End Screen](./assets/exams/exam_end_screen.png)
*End Screen after Early Hand in*

### Summary

- After you hand in, you can view the summary of your exam.
- You always have access to the summary. You can find it by following the steps displayed in: [Accessing the Exam](#accessing-the-exam). After the exam is officially finished, you can navigate to the summary using the sidebar by selecting the respective exam.
- Further you have the opportunity to export the summary as a PDF file by clicking on ![Export PDF](./assets/exams/buttons/export_pdf.png).
- The summary contains an aggregated view of all your submissions. For programming exercises, it also contains the latest commit hash and repository URI so you can review your code.

![Summary](./assets/exams/exam_summary.png)
*Summary before the results are published*

- Once the results have been published, you can view your score in the summary.
- Additionally, if within the student review period, you have the option to complain about manual assessments made. To do this, click on ![Complain](./assets/exams/buttons/complain.png) and explain your rationale.
- A second assessor, different from the original one will have the opportunity to review your complaint and respond to it.
- The complaint response will become visible to you as soon as it has been assessed.
- Again, you can export the summary including your score as a PDF file by clicking on ![Export PDF](./assets/exams/buttons/export_pdf.png). The PDF will also contain any complaints and complaint assessments.

  :::note
  The results will automatically be updated, if your complaint was successful.

### Example Solutions

- If the instructor sets the example solution publication date of the exam, the solutions will be available after that date.
- Text, modeling, file upload and programming exercises can have example solutions.

  :::warning
  You cannot see example solutions if you do not submit your exam!
  :::

![Example Solutions](./assets/exams/exam_example_solutions.png)
*Example Solutions*

- For programming exercises, clicking `Download Example Solution` button will download the solution repository.

![Example Solution for a Programming Exercise](./assets/exams/exam_example_solution_programming.png)

### Grades

- When your exam has been graded, you can view your result on the exam scores page.
- You will see your obtained points along with the maximum achievable points for each individual exercise.
- If the instructor defined a grading key for your exam, you will also see your grade.

![Exam Grade](./assets/exams/student_grade.png)
*Exam Grade*

:::note
The grades below the `First Passing Grade` are shown in red, and the passing grades are shown in green.
:::

- If the instructor defined a bonus configuration for your exam, you will also see your final grade with the applied bonus below your raw exam grade before bonus.

![Exam Grade with Bonus](./assets/exams/student_grade_with_bonus.png)
*Exam Grade with Bonus*

- For more information about all the grading intervals, you can click the ![View Grade Key](./assets/exams/buttons/view_grade_key.png) button to view all grade step boundaries with their bound inclusivity.
- A square bracket `[` or `]` in the interval of a grade step means the bound is included in the current grade step, and a parenthesis `(` or `)` means it is excluded.
- For example, if the grade step for `2.0` shows the percentage interval as `[80 - 85)` this means that a student achieving `80%` has the grade `2.0`, whereas a student achieving `85%` receives the grade right above `2.0` (i.e. `1.7` if the default grading key is used).
