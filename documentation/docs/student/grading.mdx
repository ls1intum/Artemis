# Grading

Artemis allows instructors to define grading keys for courses and exams.
When the grading key is defined, the total points obtained by a student from all exercises are calculated and mapped to a grade.

Grading Keys can be:

- `Grade`
- `Bonus`

There are two special failing grades:

- `Plagiarism Grade` (default `U`)
- `No-participation Grade` (default `X`)

## Students

During a semester, students can see their grade based on attainable points for a course.
Attainable points are the sum of the maximum points for all exercises assessed so far, independent of a student's participation.

> **Note:** The :ref:`Grades section <exam_grades>` explains reading grade boundaries.
