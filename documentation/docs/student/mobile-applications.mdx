# Mobile Applications

## Overview

Artemis supports native mobile applications available for both <a href="https://github.com/ls1intum/artemis-android">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ls1intum/artemis-ios">iOS</a>. We designed them to be applicable in lecture usage. Users can, for example, participate in quizzes and write questions. Furthermore, they can communicate with each other (available communication features on iOS and Android can be checked using <a href="#communication-features-availability-list">this list</a>).

Both apps use native user interface components and are adapted to their associated operating system. Therefore, they can differ in their usage.

The mobile applications have been designed to be compatible with all Artemis instances. Therefore, users of all Artemis instances can use the mobile application provided by us. Nevertheless, it is possible to fork our repositories and release your own versions of the mobile applications.

> **Note**
> Below, we only explain the functionalities of the mobile applications that differ or are not present in the web application.
> For all other features, which are supported by both the mobile applications and the web application, please refer to their associated documentation.

## Force Update Mechanism

The native apps support a force-update mechanism to ensure compatibility and security, especially when breaking changes are introduced.

The Artemis server provides two configurable version thresholds:

- `min` – the **minimum required version**. Users must update the app before continuing.
- `recommended` – the **recommended version**. Users are prompted to update each time the app is opened, but can continue using the app if they choose.

<Image src={forceUpdateIos} alt={"Force update iOS"} size={ImageSize.small} />
