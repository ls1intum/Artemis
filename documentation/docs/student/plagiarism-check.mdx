# Plagiarism checks

## Introduction

Artemis allows tutors and exercise instructors to check assignment submissions from students for plagiarism.
With this feature, different types of assignments can be checked in Artemis, including programming assignments, modeling assignments, and text assignments.
Plagiarism checks are available for both course and exam exercises.

## Manual Plagiarism Checks

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>Plagiarism cases are taken seriously at the university. If you receive a notification about a plagiarism case or a request for a statement, make sure to read all information carefully and respond honestly and within the given deadline. Your response may influence the final decision made by your instructor.</p>
</Callout>

### Students

After the student got a notification that the instructor asked for the statement, he or she has one week to respond.
The process is visualized in the following diagram.

2. Reply to the message of the instructor.
3. Wait for the final verdict.

### Students

When a student submits a work for which the CPC identifies significant similarity and creates a plagiarism case, the student receives a notification similar to what is sent when instructors create a classic plagiarism case.
If the exercise due date has not passed, the student can submit updated work again.
The CPC will check the submission the following night and will either remove or update the significant similarity plagiarism case based on the results of the check.
Before the exercise due date, a student cannot see the submissions of other students involved in the significant similarity plagiarism case.

When a significant similarity plagiarism case exists for the latest submission, the student sees a dedicated button redirecting to it:
<Image src={significantSimilarityButtonImg} alt={"significant-similarity-button"} size={ImageSize.large} />

A significant similarity plagiarism case contains a short message and an overview of similarity in the submission:
<Image src={significantSimilarityPlagCaseImg} alt={"significant-similarity-plagiarism-case"} size={ImageSize.large} />

In case the exercise due date has passed and student does not agree with the significant similarity plagiarism case,
the student can dispute the case within the period configured by the instructor.
