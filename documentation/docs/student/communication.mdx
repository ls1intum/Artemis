# Communication

Artemis enables students, tutors, and instructors to actively participate with its communication capabilities.
Various communication features allow students to engage with peers and ask all kinds of questions whereas moderators
(e.g., instructors and tutors) can provide general course information and answer content-related questions.
Communication can be made in different contexts, namely for lectures, exercises, or courses. Course participants can also
message each other to communicate in private. Below, you can find more information on specific features and how to use them.

## Course-Wide Messages

Artemis automatically creates course-wide channels for course-wide topics, such as
`Organization` or `Tech Support`, and various elements of a course, namely lectures, exercises, and exams. Messages can be written within these channels on the course messaging overview, which is shown in the screenshot below.

<Image src={messagingPageImg} alt={"messaging-page"} size={ImageSize.large} />

This video provides an overview of the course-wide channel types existing in a course:

<TumLiveVideo src="47622" title="Overview of course-wide channel types existing in a course" width={600} height={350} />

### Lecture Messages

*Messages that are specifically related to a certain lecture.*

These messages can also be created on the detail page of the lecture they belong to.

Exemplary lecture detail page with messages:

<Image src={lectureViewImg} alt={"lecture-view"} size={ImageSize.large} />

### Exercise Messages

*Messages that are specifically related to a certain exercise.*

These messages can also be created on the detail page of the exercise they belong to.

Exemplary exercise detail page with messages:

<Image src={exerciseViewImg} alt={"exercise-view"} size={ImageSize.large} />

## Private Communication

Users of a course can communicate in private via the Messages page. (see image below) The page consists of a collapsible
Conversation sidebar on the left, where users can search for other participants of the current course and start a conversation
with them. Private communication is only available if the course instructor enables this feature.

If the recipient is browsing another conversation when they receive a new message, an icon with an unread-messages counter is displayed in their
conversation sidebar, next to the affiliated conversation that the new message was sent to. This way, users become aware of the new message
within that discussion.

The authorities of tutors and instructors are more restricted in the Messages Page compared to the Course Communication
Overview. Messages of a conversation are exclusive to its participants and are only editable or deletable by their respective
author.

Messages do not consist of titles. Users can continue a discussion around a specific message topic by clicking the messages’
“Reply in thread” button, which opens the Thread sidebar (see image below). The Thread sidebar is a collapsible sidebar
located on the right-hand side of the Messages Page when displayed.

<Image src={messagesImg} alt={"messages"} size={ImageSize.large} />

This video shows how link previews work in Artemis:

<TumLiveVideo src="47626" title="How link previews work in Artemis" width={600} height={350} />

If the message content contains links, a preview of the link will be shown under the message. This way, users will have a good understanding
of what that link is about. If they prefer not to have a preview, they can hover over the preview and click the appearing `X` button.
The preview will be removed.

## Features for Users

This section captures the most important features that are offered to any Artemis user.

### Search, Filter, and Sort Messages

Global Search

In the course communication, users can search for messages across all channels and conversations. The global search can be accessed anytime.
To only receive results from a a specific conversation or a specific author, filters can be applied by using the keywords *in:* or *from:*
or by selecting the respective filters from the dropdown menu. When accessing the global search from a conversation by clicking on the
search icon in the top right corner, this conversation is automatically selected as filter.

<Image src={globalSearchImg} alt={"global-search"} size={ImageSize.large} />

On the course communication overview, a user can query *all* existing messages according to the following criteria and their
possible combinations:

* Text-based Search using the Global Search
  * Contents of Announcement-Message Title
  * Contents of Message Context
* Message Characteristics
  * Unresolved Messages
  * Own (messages current user has authored)
  * Reacted (messages current user has reacted or replied to)
* Sorting Configurations (ASC/DESC)
  * Creation Date

A simplified version of this feature is available on the exercise and lecture details page as well.

### Filter Pinned Messages within a Conversation

If there are any pinned messages in a conversation, a button labeled "*x* pinned messages", where *x* is the number of pinned messages,
appears at the top right of the conversation view. By clicking this button, users can filter and view only the pinned messages
within that conversation. Clicking the button again returns the view to the regular conversation.

Applied Pinned Messages Filtering

<Image src={appliedPinnedFilterImg} alt={"applied-pinned filter"} size={ImageSize.large} />

### Verify User Authority

To build trust between users utilizing the system's communication features, we display the user's role below their name in the headers of messages and their replies.
When hovering over the displayed role, a tooltip appears showing a brief explanation of that specific role. This way, the system builds trust in the author, and readers
can tangibly confirm the origin of the shared information.

Tutor Authority

<Image src={tutorRoleImg} alt={"tutor-role"} size={ImageSize.small} />

Student Authority

<Image src={studentRoleImg} alt={"student-role"} size={ImageSize.small} />

### React on Messages

To foster interaction between users, we integrate the well-known emoji reaction bar.
Each user in the course can react on any message by making use of the emoji selection button.
The ➕ emoji serves as the up-voting reaction, which influences the display order of messages.

### Reference Course Entities

Users can reference to different course entities within their messages, such as other messages, course exercises, course lectures,
and attachments of these lectures. All references are then prepended with icons which are unique to the reference's type,
to help users distinguish them conveniently. In the image below, we see all possible types of references that can be created
in an Artemis message.

<Image src={messageReferencesImg} alt={"message-references"} size={ImageSize.large} />

#### Reference Course Exercises

Users can refer to exercises of the current course, via the dropdown menu `Exercise` available on the posting markdown
editor (see image above). The following types of exercises are prepended unique icons to help distinguish the type of the
exercise being referenced.

* Text Exercise
* Quiz Exercise
* Modeling Exercise
* File Upload Exercise
* Programming Exercise

#### Reference Course Lectures

Users can refer to lectures of the current course, via the dropdown menu `Lecture` available on the posting markdown
editor (see image above).

#### Reference Lecture Attachments

Users can refer to lectures of the current course, via the dropdown menu `Lecture` available on the posting markdown
editor (see image above). Here, lecture attachments can be found in a nested structure.

#### Reference Lecture Attachment Units

Users can refer to lecture attachment units of the current course, via the dropdown menu `Lecture` available on the posting markdown
editor, see image below. Here, lecture attachment units can be found when users hover over the specific lecture.

#### Reference Lecture Unit Slides

This video describes how lecture slides can be referenced:

<TumLiveVideo src="47625" title="Reference Lecture Unit Slides" width={600} height={350} />

Users can refer to lecture unit slides of the current course, via the dropdown menu `Lecture`. Here, slides can be found when users
hover over a specific unit, see image below.

<Image src={slideMenuImg} alt={"slide-menu"} size={ImageSize.large} />

After the user references a single slide they can see it as an image included in the message. Additionally, they can preview the slide
in order to easily read the content by clicking the image.

<Image src={slidePreviewImg} alt={"slide-preview"} size={ImageSize.medium} />

<Image src={slideViewImg} alt={"slide-view"} size={ImageSize.medium} />

#### Reference other course members

Users can mention other course members within a message, by either typing an `@` character or clicking the `@` button available on the posting markdown editor. By typing in the name of a user to mention, the author of the message can search for a certain user they want to mention as demonstrated in the video below.

#### Reference channels

Similar to course members, users can reference public and course-wide channels of a course by either typing an `#` character or clicking the `#` button available on the posting markdown editor.

### Mark Your Message As Resolved

Marking a message as resolved will indicate to other users that the posted question is resolved and does not need any further input.
This can be done by clicking the check mark next to the answer message. (see image below)
Note that only the author of the message as well as a moderator can perform this action.
This is helpful for moderators to identify open questions, e.g., by applying the according filter in the course overview.
It also highlights the correct answer for other students that have a similar problem and search for a suitable solution.

<Image src={resolvedPostImg} alt={"resolved-post"} size={ImageSize.medium} />

### Forward Messages

Users can forward any message to another conversation within the same course. In the forward message dialog, they can add
additional content using the input field. At the top of the dialog, users can search for channels or users by typing into
the input bar and selecting from the auto-suggestions. They can select multiple conversations at once to forward the message
to several destinations simultaneously. On the forwarded message view, users can navigate to the exact location of the original
message by clicking the *View Conversation* button.

Forward Message Dialog

<Image src={forwardMessageDialogImg} alt={"forward-message-dialog"} size={ImageSize.large} />

Forwarded Message View

<Image src={forwardedMessageImg} alt={"forwarded-message"} size={ImageSize.large} />

### Save Messages

Users can save messages and access them later from the Saved Messages section in the sidebar. Saved messages are
organized into three categories: *In Progress*, *Completed*, and *Archived*. Messages initially appear in the *In Progress*
section and can be marked as done to move them to *Completed*, or archived to move them to the *Archived* section.
Clicking on a saved message navigates the user directly to its exact location within the conversation.

<Image src={saveMessagesImg} alt={"save-messages"} size={ImageSize.large} />

### Expand Thread to Full-Screen

Users can expand a thread to cover the entire conversation view by clicking the expand button located at the top right
corner of the answer thread. Clicking the same button again returns the thread to its original size.

<Image src={expandedThreadImg} alt={"expanded-thread"} size={ImageSize.large} />

## Profile Pictures

Users can upload a profile picture in their account settings to enhance personal recognition. Once set, the profile picture will appear alongside any messages they post. The following video provides a step-by-step guide on how to upload a profile picture:

<TumLiveVideo src="61336" title="Profile Pictures" width={600} height={350} />

## Draft Messages

When composing a message or replying in a thread on the WebApp, Artemis automatically saves your input as a **draft**. This ensures that unfinished messages are not lost when navigating between conversations or accidentally closing the tab.

Draft messages are:

* Stored locally (not synced across devices)
* Associated with the user and the corresponding conversation or thread
* Automatically restored when reopening the same context
* Removed once the message is sent
* Automatically deleted after 7 days if not submitted

<TumLiveVideo src="61870" title="Draft Messages" width={600} height={350} />
