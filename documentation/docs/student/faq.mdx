## What Are FAQs in Artemis?

Artemis supports the coordination and management of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) within a course.
These FAQs offer quick and clear answers to common questions from students, helping to streamline communication and make important information easily accessible.

FAQs are typically added and maintained by instructors and tutors to address recurring questions during the course.
Students can browse them at any time to find information regarding exercises, tools, deadlines, assessments, course processes, etc.

## Student Overview of FAQs

In the student view, only **ACCEPTED** FAQs are shown.
Students can search for FAQs using the search bar and filter them by topic to quickly find the relevant information they are looking for.

Available filters are shown in a tag panel where students can enable one or multiple categories such as _Communication_, _Tutorial Groups_, _Project_, _Exercises_, _General_, etc.
This enhances navigation significantly — especially once many FAQs exist.
