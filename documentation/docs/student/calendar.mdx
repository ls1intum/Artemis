# Calendar
Artemis features a calendar that allows users to quickly view all important events related to a specific course.

## General Information
The Artemis calendar can be found in the Calendar tab of the course overview.
It displays important events related to lectures, tutorials, exercises, and exams.

The following table shows the dates that are displayed as calendar events, if available.
Note that an event can either represent a specific point in time (in which case it only has a start date) or a time period (in which case it has both a start and an end date).

| Artemis Concept  | Dates                                                            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lecture  | start, end  |
| Tutorial  | start, end  |
| Exercise  | release, start, due, assessment due  |
| Exam  | start, end, results release, student review start, student review end |

## Switching between Presentations
To view events in the calendar, users can switch between a high-level overview and a more detailed presentation.
The available views differ between small and large devices to optimize the calendar layout for each screen size.

On larger devices, such as laptops and desktop computers, the calendar offers a high-level **month** presentation and a more detailed **week** presentation.

<Image src={desktopMonthPresentationImage} alt={"Month Presentation for Large Devices"}  caption={"Month Presentation for Large Devices"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>
<Image src={desktopWeekPresentationImage} alt={"Week Presentation for Large Devices"} caption={"Week Presentation for Large Devices"} size={ImageSize.large} hideBorder={true}></Image>

On small devices, such as mobile phones, there is a high-level **month** presentation and a detailed **day** presentation.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={mobileMonthPresentationImage} alt={"Month Presentation for Small Devices"} caption={"Month Presentation for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '550px' }} hideBorder={true}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileDayPresentationImage} alt={"Day Presentation for Small Devices"} caption={"Day Presentation for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '550px' }} hideBorder={true}></Image>
</div>

## Viewing Event Details
In the desktop month and week presentations, as well as in the mobile day presentation, users can click on an event to view its details.

## Filtering Events
By using the filter component of the calendar, users can include or exclude events based on their type.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={desktopFilterComponent} alt={"Filter Component for Large Devices"} caption={"Filter Component for Large Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '300px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileFilterComponent} alt={"Filter Component for Small Devices"} caption={"Filter Component for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '300px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
</div>

## Subscribing External Calendars
Finally, users can subscribe external calendar applications to the Artemis calendar by clicking the Subscribe button, selecting a language, choosing which event types to include, and copying the generated link.
This link can then be pasted into the settings of third-party calendar applications (e.g., Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, etc.) to subscribe them to the Artemis calendar.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'start', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={desktopSubscriptionComponent} alt={"iCalendar Subscription Popover for Large Devices"} caption={"iCalendar Subscription Popover for Large Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '340px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileSubscriptionComponent} alt={"iCalendar Subscription Popover for Small Devices"} caption={"iCalendar Subscription Popover for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '340px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
</div>
