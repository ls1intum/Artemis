# Calendar
Artemis features a calendar that allows users to quickly view all important events related to a specific course.

## General Information
The Artemis calendar can be found in the calendar tab of the course overview.
The calendar contains important events about lectures, tutorials, exercises and exams.

The following table shows the dates that are displayed as calendar events if they are available.
Note that an event can either represent a point in time (in this case it only has a start date) or a time period (in this case it has a start and end date).
Because of this two dates are occasionally represented as one event (e.g. if both start date and end date of a lecture are available, they are bundled together in one lecture event).

| Entity  | Dates                                                            |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lecture  | start, end  |
| Tutorial  | start, end  |
| Exercise  | release, start, due, assessment due  |
| Exam  | start, end, results release, student review start, student review end |

## Switching between Presentations
To view events in the calendar, the user can switch between a high level presentation and a more detailed presentation.
The presentations vary for small and large devices to optimize the layout of the calendar for a given screen size.

On big devices such as laptops and desktop computers there is a high-level month presentation and a more detailed week presentation.

<Image src={desktopMonthPresentationImage} alt={"Month Presentation for Large Devices"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>
<Image src={desktopWeekPresentationImage} alt={"Week Presentation for Large Devices"} size={ImageSize.large}></Image>

On small devices such as mobile phones there is a high-level month presentation and a detailed day presentation.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={mobileMonthPresentationImage} alt={"Month Presentation for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '550px' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileDayPresentationImage} alt={"Day Presentation for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '550px' }}></Image>
</div>

## Viewing Event Details
In the desktop month and week presentation, as well as in the mobile day presentation, the user can click on an event to reveal its details.

## Navigating in Time
On both large and small devices the user can click chevron buttons to navigate backwards or forwards in time.
Additionally he can use the today button to jump to the instance of the currently selected presentation that displays the current day.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={desktopNavigationControls} alt={"Navigation Controls for Large Devices"} style={{ maxWidth: '330px' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileNavigationControls} alt={"Navigation Controls for Small Devices"} style={{ maxWidth: '530px' }}></Image>
</div>

## Filtering Events
By using the filter component of the calendar, the user can include or exclude events based on their type.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
    <Image src={desktopFilterComponent} alt={"Filter Component for Large Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '300px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileFilterComponent} alt={"Filter Component for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '300px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
</div>

## Subscribing external Calendars
Finally the user can subscribe external calendar applications to the Artemis calendar by clicking the subscribe button, selecting a language, choosing
which events types to include and copying the generated link. This link can be pasted in the setting of third party calendar apps to subscribe them to the Artemis calendar.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={desktopSubscriptionComponent} alt={"iCalendar Subscription Component for Large Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '340px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
    <Image src={mobileSubscriptionComponent} alt={"iCalendar Subscription Component for Small Devices"} style={{ maxHeight: '340px', maxWidth: 'none' }}></Image>
</div>
