# Learning Analytics

## Overview

Artemis integrates different statistics for students to compare themselves to the course average.
It allows instructors to evaluate the average student performance based on exercises and competencies.

## Learning Analytics for Students

Students can access their individual learning analytics for a specific course by navigating to the course's <code>Statistics</code> page.

### Points per Exercise

To get a quick overview about the achieved points per exercise, a bar chart shows the achieved points of the student for every exercise grouped by the exercise type.
