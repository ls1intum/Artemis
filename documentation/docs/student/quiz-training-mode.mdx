# Quiz Training Mode

The Quiz Training Mode allows you to reinforce your knowledge through repeated practice of quiz questions. The system uses a spaced-repetition algorithm to ensure you review questions at optimal intervals.

---

## Getting Started

When you first visit the Quiz Training, a welcome dialog appears explaining the key features:

### How It Works

Quiz Training is based on the principle of spaced repetition. Questions you answer correctly are repeated at longer intervals, while incorrectly answered questions appear more frequently.

### League System

The training uses a motivating league system with five levels:

- **Bronze League:** 0-50 points
- **Silver League:** 50-150 points
- **Gold League:** 150-300 points
- **Diamond League:** 300-500 points
- **Master League:** 500+ points

Each correctly answered question earns you points, allowing you to advance to higher leagues.

### Scoring

Point allocation depends on the difficulty and your performance on the question. Graded questions count toward your progress, while ungraded questions are only for practice.

### Leaderboard Settings

You can choose whether your name appears in the course leaderboard. You can change this setting at any time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**When should I answer questions again?**
The system displays a countdown showing when the next questions are available for review. This is based on your past performance.

**Can I change my leaderboard visibility?**
Yes, click the **"View description"** button on the overview page to adjust your settings. You can also change the settings in your user settings under quiz training

**What happens if I answer a question incorrectly?**
The question will be repeated at shorter intervals until you answer it correctly. Your will not earn or loose points for wrong answered questions.

**Do all questions count toward my score?**
Only graded questions count toward your score and league progress. Ungraded questions are solely for practice.

**I answered a graded question correctly, but did not receive points. Why?**
If you answered the question wrong before, you will not receive points for the same question if you answer it correctly on the same day. This is to prevent users from repeatedly answering a question wrong and then correct to secure points.

**What is spaced-repetition?**
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals to enhance long-term retention.
Correctly answered questions are shown less frequently, while incorrectly answered questions appear more often.
