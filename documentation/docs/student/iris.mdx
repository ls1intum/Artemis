# Iris

Iris is an AI-powered virtual tutor integrated directly into Artemis. It provides context-aware support for programming exercises and lecture content, helping students learn independently through guided hints and explanations rather than giving away solutions.

## What Iris Can Do

- **Context-Aware Help:** Iris can reference your problem statement, code, and build results — no copy-pasting needed.
- **Guided Learning:** Iris provides hints and explanations to help you solve problems independently.
- **Lecture Support:** Iris can help you understand course-specific lecture content.

## What to Expect

- **Guide, Not Solve:** Iris does not provide complete solutions. It supports your problem-solving process.
- **Stay on Topic:** Iris answers questions about course content and programming topics only. It does not handle off-topic requests or organizational information.
- **Own Your Work:** Use Iris as a learning aid while maintaining academic integrity. Your submissions must reflect your own understanding and effort.

## How to Use Iris

1. Open a programming exercise or navigate to a course that has Iris enabled.
2. Open the Iris chatbot sidebar.
3. Ask your question — Iris will use your current exercise context to provide relevant guidance.
4. Rate answers and conversations to help improve Iris over time.
