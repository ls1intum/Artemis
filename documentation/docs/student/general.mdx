# General Information

Artemis offers different exercise types that share common characteristics:

- **Release Date:** When the exercise becomes visible to students. If none is set, it is visible immediately.
- **Due Date:** The final date students can submit their solutions.
- **Assessment Due Date:** The date until which tutors complete assessments. Feedback is released after this date.
- **Points:** Each exercise grants points, which may count toward the course score or serve as bonus points.

## Exercise Organization and Navigation

Students can access the exercise overview by clicking the **Exercises** tab.

The exercise overview categorizes exercises by time periods:

- **Future:** Not yet released.
- **Due Soon:** Active and due within 3 days.
- **Current:** Available, not due within 3 days.
- **Past:** Closed, submission no longer possible.
- **No Date:** Exercises without time restrictions.

When sections (like *No Date*) contain more than 5 exercises, Artemis may group them by week for easier navigation.
