# Local Moodle Environment Setup for LTI Development

This guide will help developers quickly establish a consistent and reliable Moodle environment for development purposes.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>The setup uses a docker-compose file based on configurations that Bitnami provided under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
    You can find the original configuration in the <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/moodle">Bitnami GitHub repository</a>.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure your system meets the minimum Docker and Docker Compose requirements. Refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for system requirements.
- If you don't have Docker installed on your system, follow the installation instructions for your specific platform on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Docker Compose is a separate tool bundled with Docker on some platforms, but you might need to install it separately on others. Refer to the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for details.

## Setup Instructions

The setup leverages [Bitnami's Docker images for Moodle](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/moodle), which are included in this repository's docker-compose file, to ensure a streamlined and reliable deployment.

Moodle requires access to a MySQL or MariaDB database to store information. Bitnami uses the Bitnami Docker Image for MariaDB for the database requirements.

To initialize your Moodle environment, navigate to the `docker/moodle/` directory containing the `moodle.yml` docker-compose file in this repository and execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f moodle.yml up
```

This command will download the necessary Docker images and initialize the Moodle instance with the specified environment and configurations.

## Configuration

When you start the Moodle image, you can adjust the instance's configuration by passing one or more environment variables on the docker-compose file.

### Available environment variables

- **MOODLE_USERNAME**: Moodle application username. Default: user
- **MOODLE_PASSWORD**: Moodle application password. Default: bitnami
- **MOODLE_EMAIL**: Moodle application email. Default: user@example.com
- **MOODLE_SITE_NAME**: Moodle site name. Default: New Site
- **MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP**: Do not initialize the Moodle database for a new deployment. This setting is necessary if you use a database with Moodle data. Default: no
- **MOODLE_HOST**: Allows you to configure Moodle's wwwroot feature. Ex: example.com. By default, it is a PHP superglobal variable. Default: `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`
- **MOODLE_REVERSEPROXY**: Allows you to activate the reverse proxy feature of Moodle. Default: no
- **MOODLE_SSLPROXY**: Allows you to activate the sslproxy feature of Moodle. Default: no
- **MOODLE_LANG**: Allows you to set the default site language. Default: en

## Customization

You can customize the Moodle port number over the docker-compose.yml file.

```yaml
moodle:
    image: bitnami/moodle:latest
    ports:
      - '8085:8080'
      - '443:8443'
```

## Accessing Moodle

You can access your local Moodle instance over `localhost:port` in the browser. The default configuration sets it to `http://localhost:8085/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuring Time Zone

For LTI 1.3 integration, accurate timing for tokens is crucial. Set the time zone in the `moodle.yml` file to ensure the correct local time.

For example, to align the Docker container's operations with Berlin's local time, which follows Central European Time (CET) in winter and Central European Summer Time (CEST) in summer:

```yaml
environment:
    - TZ=Europe/Berlin
```

This setting ensures that all operations within the Docker container, including token generation and expiration, adhere to the Central European Time zone.
