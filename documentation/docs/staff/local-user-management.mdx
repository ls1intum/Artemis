# Using Local User Management

If you want to test in a local environment using different users, it makes sense to rely on local instead of external user management.

## Configuration

Go to the `application-artemis.yml` file, and set `use-external` in the `user-management` section to `false`.

```yaml title="src/main/resources/config/application-artemis.yml"
artemis:
  user-management:
    use-external: false
```

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
When using local user management, Artemis will manage user accounts internally instead of delegating authentication to an external system like LDAP.
This is particularly useful for development and testing environments.
</Callout>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
Local user management is intended for development and testing purposes only. For production environments, use external user management systems with proper security configurations.
</Callout>
