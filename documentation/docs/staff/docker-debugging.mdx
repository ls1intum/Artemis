# Debugging Artemis in Docker container

Sometimes it is useful to debug Artemis while it is running in a Docker container as some bugs can be most easily reproduced in a Docker setup (e.g., for multi-node setups).

Follow these steps to set up debugging:

---

## 1. Adjust the Docker Setup

Adjust the docker setup to start the JVM with the correct arguments and to expose a debug port.

This can be done by adding the following lines to the relevant docker compose file and setting the debug port for each `artemis` service:

```yaml
environment:
  - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:<debug-port>
ports:
  - "<debug-port>:<host-port>"
```

This will start the JVM with the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) agent, allowing you to connect a debugger to port `<host-port>`.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
    If you use a multi-node setup, you need to add this to all nodes that you want to debug. Make sure that all use different host ports.
</Callout>

---

## 2. Use Your Own PR Image (Optional)

If you want to debug your own PR, replace the image name with your own PR image
```bash
ghcr.io/ls1intum/artemis:pr-<pr-number>
```

---

## 3. Configure IntelliJ Remote Debugging

Use the `Remote Java Debugging for Docker` run configuration:

- This configuration is set up to connect to port 5005 as the default debug port.
- If you used another port for the debugger port on the host, you need to change the port in the run configuration accordingly.
- You can find the run configuration in the `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog in IntelliJ under `Remote JVM Debug -> Remote Java Debugging for Docker`.
- For each Artemis node you want to debug, you need to create a separate run configuration with the correct port.

---

## 4. Start the Docker Compose File

Start the relevant docker compose file with:

```bash
docker compose -f <docker compose file name> up -d
```

---

## 5. Handle Liquibase Errors (If Necessary)

If the server fails to start with Liquibase errors, you can run the following command to reset the database:

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.danger}>
    This command **deletes all data** in the `artemis` database by dropping it. Make sure you have a backup if you need to preserve existing data.
</Callout>

```bash
docker exec -i artemis-mysql mysql -u root -p'' -e "DROP DATABASE artemis;"
```

Afterward, you can start the server again with the same command as in step 4.

---

## 6. Start the Remote Debugger

Start the Remote JVM Debug configuration in IntelliJ.

---

## 7. Set Breakpoints

Set breakpoints in the code you want to debug and start debugging!
