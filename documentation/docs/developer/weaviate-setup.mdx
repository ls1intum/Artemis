# Weaviate Setup

This guide explains how to set up a local Weaviate instance for development with Artemis.
Weaviate is a vector database that is used by the EduTelligence suite (Iris/Pyris) for storing and retrieving embeddings.

In the future Artemis will also directly communicate with Weaviate to offer a global keyword and semantic search across all entities (lectures, exercises, chats, ...).

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  <p>Setting up Weaviate is only required when running Pyris locally for Iris functionality or developing the global search feature.
    If you only need basic Artemis features without AI assistance, you can skip this setup.</p>
</Callout>

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine
- At least 2GB of available disk space for data storage

---

## Quick Start

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
  All commands in this guide should be run from the `docker` directory.
</Callout>

  ```bash
  cd docker
  ```

### Starting Weaviate

Start the Weaviate service:

```bash
docker compose -f weaviate.yml up -d
```

This will start Weaviate with the following configuration:

| Service   | Port  | Description            |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| REST API  | 8001  | HTTP REST interface    |
| gRPC      | 50051 | gRPC interface         |

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.info}>
  The configuration should be kept aligned with the settings in the [edutelligence/iris repository](https://github.com/ls1intum/edutelligence/tree/main/iris).
</Callout>

### Verifying the Installation

Check that Weaviate is running correctly:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8001/v1/.well-known/ready
```

You should receive a response indicating the service is ready.

### Stopping Weaviate

To stop the Weaviate service:

```bash
docker compose -f weaviate.yml down
```

---

## Configuration

### Default Configuration

The default configuration is stored in `docker/weaviate/default.env`:

```bash
QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT=25
AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED=true
PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/weaviate
DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE=none
ENABLE_MODULES=
CLUSTER_HOSTNAME=artemis
LIMIT_RESOURCES=true
DISK_USE_WARNING_PERCENTAGE=80
```

### Configuration Options

| Variable                                  | Default           | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT`                    | 25                | Default limit for query results                   |
| `AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED` | true              | Allow anonymous access (development only)         |
| `PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH`                   | /var/lib/weaviate | Path for data persistence inside container        |
| `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE`               | none              | Default vectorizer (none for external embeddings) |
| `ENABLE_MODULES`                          | (empty)           | Additional modules to enable                      |
| `CLUSTER_HOSTNAME`                        | artemis           | Hostname for the Weaviate cluster node            |
| `LIMIT_RESOURCES`                         | true              | Enable resource limiting                          |
| `DISK_USE_WARNING_PERCENTAGE`             | 80                | Warn when disk usage exceeds this percentage      |

### Data Persistence

By default, Weaviate data is persisted in `.docker-data/weaviate-data`. You can customize this by setting the `WEAVIATE_VOLUME_MOUNT` environment variable:

```bash
export WEAVIATE_VOLUME_MOUNT=/path/to/your/data
docker compose -f weaviate.yml up -d
```

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>Anonymous access is enabled by default for development convenience. For production deployments, configure proper authentication.</p>
</Callout>

---

## Integration with Artemis

To enable Weaviate integration in Artemis, add the following to your `application-local.yml`:

```yaml
artemis:
    weaviate:
        enabled: true                     # Disabled by default; set to true to enable Weaviate integration
        host: localhost                   # Weaviate server hostname
        port: 8001                        # Weaviate HTTP port (avoid conflicts with main app)
        grpc-port: 50051                  # Weaviate gRPC port for better performance
        scheme: http                      # http scheme for development only, otherwise https should be used
```

Ensure that Weaviate is running before starting Artemis.
Artemis will connect to Weaviate to store and retrieve embeddings and metadata for global search functionality, e.g., retrieving lecture content.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts

If port 8001 or 50051 is already in use, create or edit `docker/.env` (which is gitignored) and set custom ports:

```bash
WEAVIATE_REST_PORT=8002
WEAVIATE_GRPC_PORT=50052
```

Remember to update the Pyris configuration accordingly.

### Container Not Starting

Check the container logs for errors:

```bash
docker compose -f weaviate.yml logs weaviate
```

### Resetting Data

To completely reset Weaviate data:

```bash
docker compose -f weaviate.yml down
rm -rf .docker-data/weaviate-data
docker compose -f weaviate.yml up -d
```

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
    <p>This will delete all stored embeddings and require re-indexing of lecture content.</p>
</Callout>
