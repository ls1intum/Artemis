# Coding and Design Guidelines

Welcome to the Artemis Coding and Design Guidelines. These guidelines help maintain code quality, consistency, and best practices across the project.

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
**UI/UX Guidelines**

For all UI-related development work, you must follow the **[AET UI/UX Guidelines](https://ls1intum.github.io/ui-ux-guidelines/docs/intro)**. These external guidelines cover design principles (simplicity, consistency, feedback, accessibility, learnability), general conventions, accessibility standards, and component styling (buttons, headings, spacing, colors).

The Artemis-specific guidelines below focus on **implementation details** for Angular/TypeScript development, while the AET UI/UX Guidelines define the **design standards** you must follow.

## Client Guidelines

Guidelines for Angular/TypeScript frontend development:

- **[Client Development](/developer/guidelines/client)** - Angular development practices, naming conventions, components, and advanced topics
- **[Client Theming](/developer/guidelines/client-design)** - Theme management, color usage, and styling guidelines
- **[Client Tests](/developer/guidelines/client-tests)** - Testing practices, mocking strategies, and coverage standards

## Server Guidelines

Guidelines for Spring Boot/Java backend development:

- **[Server Development](/developer/guidelines/server)** - Java best practices, project structure, REST APIs, and authorization
- **[Server Tests](/developer/guidelines/server-tests)** - Server testing strategies, ArchUnit, and performance tips
- **[Database](/developer/guidelines/database)** - Database design, relationships, cascade types, and dynamic fetching
- **[Performance](/developer/guidelines/performance)** - Performance optimization, data economy, paging, and query optimization
- **[Criteria Builder](/developer/guidelines/criteria-builder)** - Type-safe dynamic queries using JPA Criteria API

**Code Quality First**

- Prioritize code quality and test coverage
- Reuse code and avoid duplication
- Write meaningful tests
- Follow established patterns and conventions
</Callout>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.warning}>
**Performance Matters**

- Write performant queries that scale to 1000+ objects
- Use lazy loading by default
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Avoid N+1 query problems
</Callout>

<Callout variant={CalloutVariant.danger}>
**Security is Critical**

- Never trust user input
- Always validate and sanitize data
- Use proper authorization checks
- Follow the principle of least privilege
</Callout>
