# The CODEOWNERS file defines individuals or teams that are
# responsible for code this repository.

# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a
# pull request that modifies code that they own.
# Code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @krusche and @jpbernius will be
# requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
