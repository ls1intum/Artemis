## Analysis

### Analysis Object Model 
> What are the involved Analysis Objects? 

### Dynamic Behavior 
> Include dynamic models (Activity Diagram, State Chart Diagram, Communication Diagram) here to outline the dynamic nature of the PROBLEM 


## System Architecture 

### Subsystem Decomposition
> Show the involved subsystems and their interfaces. Make sure to describe the APIs that you add/change in detail. Model the DTOs you intend to (re)use or change! 

### Persistent Data Management
> Describe the Database changes you intend to make.
> Outline new configuration options you plan to introduce
> Describe all other data persistence mechanisms you may use.

### Access Control / Security Aspects 
> Describe the access control considerations for your feature

### Other Design Decisions
> Potential topics to discuss here include: WebSockets, testing strategies.

## UI/UX Design
> Screenshots of the final UI mockups (mandatory): Please include screenshots to provide a clear and persistent visual reference of the design. 
> Link to the design mockup (optional): Additionally, you may include a link to the live design mockup (e.g., Figma, Sketch) for a more interactive view. Note that this link is supplementary and should not replace the required screenshots.
