 * <p><strong>The Bitwarden Plugin does not work properly on Chrome; the returned credential is malformed and cannot be stringified.</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>Unfortunately, Bitwarden does not seem to show any interest in fixing this issue:
 * <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/issues/12060" target="_blank">https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/issues/12060</a>,
 * and relies on other developers to fix it within their applications. ðŸ˜ž</p>
 *
 * <p>As Bitwarden is a widely used password manager, we decided to implement a workaround in our application
 * to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>
 *
 * <p>The underlying issue is that Bitwarden's returned credential does not implement <code>toJSON()</code>,
 * which is required for <code>JSON.stringify()</code> to work. As a result, the browser cannot serialize the object properly,
 * causing credential registration and login with passkeys to fail when using the Bitwarden browser plugin in Chrome.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>We fix the issue by creating a serializable copy of the object with its properties converted into the correct format.</strong></p>
