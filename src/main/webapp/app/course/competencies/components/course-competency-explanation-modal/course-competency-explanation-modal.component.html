            <h5>What is Adaptive Learning?</h5>
            <p>
                Adaptive learning tailors educational content to each student's unique needs, adjusting in real-time based on their performance. By providing personalized support
                and challenges, it helps students learn more efficiently, stay engaged, and achieve mastery at their own pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Artemis course competencies are the foundation for Adaptive Learning. They are overarching learning objectives that can be obtained by interacting with different
                lectures and exercises. Based on these competency models Artemis can offer students personalized learning paths that fit their individual needs.
            </p>

            <h5>Why?</h5>
            <p>
                Competency-based education empowers students to master skills at their own pace, ensuring real progress and confidence. It creates a personalized, engaging learning
                experience that leads to better outcomes and long-term success. So, even without enabling learning paths, students benefit from being able to track their progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                With learning paths, students receive recommendations to support their learning efforts. Making it easier for them to master all the required competencies of a
                course.

            <h5>How to create a course competency?</h5>
            <p>In general we distinguish between a competency and a prerequisite.</p>
            <p>
                To create a competency, click the 'Create Competency' button at the top of the competency page. On the creation page, you can specify a unique name and an
                appropriate description for the competency. Additionally, you have the option to set a recommended completion date, which indicates to students by when they should
                master the connected learning objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also add taxonomy to the competency, providing students with greater insight into its purpose. If certain learning objects within this competency are
                optional, you can establish a threshold for when the competency will be considered mastered. You also have the option to mark the entire competency as optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you can directly link lecture units to the competency. While you can also connect exercises to a competency, this must be done in the exercise
                edit/creation view.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to creating competencies or prerequisites yourself, you can also import them from other courses or utilize standardized competencies. For more
                information on this process, please refer to the user <a [href]="DOCUMENTATION_LINK" target="_blank">manual for Artemis.</a>

            <h5>What are course competency relations?</h5>
            <p>
                Course competencies can build upon or depend on one another, which is why you can establish different types of relationships between them. Competencies can either
                MATCH, EXTEND, or ASSUME each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create these relationships, open the 'Edit Relations' modal. In this modal, you can either select the related competencies or click on each one consecutively.
                After that, choose the desired relation type and create the relationship. To update or delete a relation, simply click on the specific relation and either update
                the relation type in the form or delete it.
