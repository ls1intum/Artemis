            <h5>What is adaptive learning?</h5>
            <p>
                Adaptive Learning in Artemis focuses on course competencies, which are overarching learning objectives that connect different lectures and exercises (learning
                objects). Additionally, Artemis can offer students personalized learning paths based on these competencies and their interrelationships.
            </p>
            <p>Students can track their progress in their competency view and work on the next recommended learning object in their Learning Paths.</p>

            <h5>How to create a course competency?</h5>
            <p>In general we distinguish between a competency and a prerequisite.</p>
            <p>
                To create a competency, click the 'Create Competency' button at the top of the competency page. On the creation page, you can specify a unique name and an
                appropriate description for the competency. Additionally, you have the option to set a recommended completion date, which indicates to students by when they should
                master the connected learning objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also add taxonomy to the competency, providing students with greater insight into its purpose. If certain learning objects within this competency are
                optional, you can establish a threshold for when the competency will be considered mastered. You also have the option to mark the entire competency as optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you can directly link lecture units to the competency. While you can also connect exercises to a competency, this must be done in the exercise
                edit/creation view.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to creating competencies or prerequisites yourself, you can also import them from other courses or utilize standardized competencies. For more
                information on this process, please refer to the user <a [href]="DOCUMENTATION_LINK" target="_blank">manual for Artemis.</a>

            <h5>What are course competency relations?</h5>
            <p>
                Course competencies can build upon or depend on one another, which is why you can establish different types of relationships between them. Competencies can either
                MATCH, EXTEND, or ASSUME each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create these relationships, open the 'Edit Relations' modal. In this modal, you can either select the related competencies or click on each one consecutively.
                After that, choose the desired relation type and create the relationship. To update or delete a relation, simply click on the specific relation and either update
                the relation type in the form or delete it.
