                NOTE: Because we DON'T WANT the selected text to get deselected
                when we click on the call-to-action, we have to PREVENT THE
                DEFAULT BEHAVIOR and STOP PROPAGATION on some of the events. The
                byproduct of this is that the (click) event won't fire. As such,
                we then have to consume the click-intent by way of the (mouseup)
                event.
