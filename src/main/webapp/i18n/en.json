Afterwards you can perform a manual or automated evaluation of the students' submissions. The results will be published on the specified date. \n\nTest exams provide you with the possibility to provide students with a practice opportunity for the end-of-semester exam. The main difference is that you choose a working window within which students can freely start the exam. Students then have the configured working time to complete the exam. After submitting, students immediately get the automated assessment for programming and quizzes. Manual correction of the submissions is not necessary."},"exerciseTypes":{"title":"Multiple Exercise Types","shortDescription":"Programming, modeling, text, file-upload and quiz exercises.","descriptionTextOne":"Artemis supports programming, modeling, text, file-upload and quiz exercises with multiple-choice, drag and drop, and short answer questions in exam mode.\n\nFor programming exercises, students may choose to work with the online code editor or to clone the repository and work on the exercise in the integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice. Artemis uses the integrated and easy-to-use Apollon Editor for modeling exercises. It supports multiple diagram types, including UML class, activity, object, use case, communication, component, and deployment diagrams, as well as Petri nets and syntax trees. Your students can create models by intuitively dragging and dropping objects into the editor and connecting them using the appropriate arrows. Through the variety of its available exercise types, Artemis fulfills the requirements of most software engineering courses."},"exerciseVariants":{"title":"Exercise Variants","shortDescription":"Make every student exam unique by adding variants to each exercise.","descriptionTextOne":"Artemis provides the possibility to create a unique exam for every student. You can create or import exercise groups that each contain multiple exercises. The number of exercise groups reflects the number of exercises on the exam.

After submitting the exam, you can assess your submissions. The results will immediately be displayed in the test run summary, where you can also simulate complaints during a student review. Finally, you can evaluate the complaints to complete the exam process. \n\nTest runs are also a great way to familiarize your assessment team with the platform and the exam!"},"sessionMonitoring":{"title":"Exam Session Monitoring","shortDescription":"Monitor the exam session to identify unusual activity.","descriptionTextOne":"Without a physical presence, it can feel as if you cannot observe your students closely enough. To counteract this, Artemis includes exam session monitoring. Artemis generates an exam session for every participant in the exam. The exam session contains, among other fields, when and where the student started the exam, the student's public IP address, and a unique fingerprint based on their browser and operating system. Additionally, the exam session generates a unique identifier that is sent with every request. Students have the option to switch between computers during the exam and also continue working while offline. As an instructor, you have the capability to analyze all students' sessions and behavior and flag those which appear suspicious."},"plagiarismDetection":{"title":"Plagiarism detection","shortDescription":"Automatically detect and flag plagiarism attempts.","descriptionTextOne":"Artemis can support instructors in detecting plagiarism attempts. This is done by analyzing similarities among all student submissions and flagging those which exceed a given threshold. With the integrated plagiarism editor, you can compare all flagged submissions side by side and confirm those cases which show themselves as real plagiarism attempts. You can choose between different plagiarism detection strategies to apply the one that suits your needs. Additionally, instructors can download a CSV report of accepted and rejected plagiarism attempts for further processing on external systems."},"anonymousAssessment":{"title":"Anonymous Assessment","shortDescription":"Anonymous assessment procedure to avoid prejudice.","descriptionTextOne":"The assessors can access students' exam submissions via the Assessment Dashboard. On this dashboard, they can request a new submission, provided that one is available for assessment. All submissions are anonymized to avoid bias or favoritism. To improve the accuracy and consistency of the assessors, you can define assessment instructions, sample submissions, and sample assessments to establish a common base of the grading expectations before the assessors begin."},"automaticAssessment":{"title":"Automatic Assessment","shortDescription":"Automatic assessment of programming and quiz, semi-automatic assessment of text and modeling exercises.","descriptionTextOne":"Artemis supports correction with automatic and semi-automatic assessments for various exercise types. For quiz exercises, you may specify the correct solution in advance. After conducting an exam, you can prompt Artemis to automatically evaluate all submissions. For programming exercises, you can create a test suite, which for example applies structural and behavioral tests. These tests are then automatically executed for each student's submission at the end of the exam and evaluated accordingly. You can adjust the weight of each test, assign bonus points, and use static analysis tools to further support your assessment. All static analysis rules can be weighted independently, and you can define limits on how many points should be deducted if the same error occurs more than once. Finally, the automatic evaluation of programming tasks can be checked and confirmed or overwritten through manual evaluation. \n\nFor text and modeling exercises, you can activate automatic correction suggestions. Artemis uses machine learning to identify similar elements across submissions. Artemis analyzes instructor assessments to identify correct and incorrect elements and suggest assessments to the assessor. The goal is to reduce the required effort for the assessment and increase the quality and consistency of the evaluation."},"reviewIndividualExams":{"title":"Review Individual Exams","shortDescription":"Review individual student exams with their submissions and scores.","descriptionTextOne":"While the assessment process is anonymous for tutors, as an instructor you can access and review individual student exams and their summaries. A student exam summary contains all the student's solutions to the exercises as well as their exercise-specific scores. You can also review their code by using the link to their exercise repository. This is also displayed on the student summary page together with the last commit hash. "},"assessmentMonitoring":{"title":"Monitor Tutor and Assessment Progress","shortDescription":"Assessment dashboard for anonymous correction queuing. Includes a progress tracker for the assessment process.","descriptionTextOne":"Using the assessment dashboard, you always have an overview of how the assessment of the exam is coming along. This is indicated using an intuitive progress bar for every exercise in the exam which accurately displays how many submissions remain to be assessed. Lose no time and immediately publish the results once all exams have been assessed. You can also view the scores page to gain insights into the exam's outcome/results."},"complaints":{"title":"Offer Student Review","shortDescription":"Allow students to review their exam. Review complaints and automatically apply changes.","descriptionTextOne":"After the results have been published, you can define a student review period. Each student can review their exam comfortably from their computer and take their time to understand the assessment. If they believe that they have found a mistake in an assessment, they can use the complaint feature to request a review. Additionally, students can provide their reasoning through a text note to clarify their objections. All complaints are collected and can be reviewed from the Assessment Dashboard. Each complaint is assessable by a third person (i.e. not the original assessor). They can review the assessment and decide to either accept or reject the student's complaint. The points given are then updated automatically, including the exam result."},"statistics":{"title":"Generate Statistics","shortDescription":"Generate exam statistics to gain insights into the students' performance.","descriptionTextOne":"The exam is over, all exams have been assessed and the student complaints are evaluated. Now what?\n\nYou can evaluate the exam outcome using the statistics generated by Artemis. Review the students' performance using various metrics such as average, median, and standard deviation.

Artemis provides a checklist that gives you an overview of each step of an exam from creation of the exercises to exporting the results. The exam checklist contains the next action you need to take on a step and summarizes the progress taken so far to help you carry out all tasks correctly and completely. It also has navigation buttons so you can quickly take related actions or examine the progress in detail. Last but not least, it has a more compact overview version in the exam list page to glance over the preparation, conduction and correction status of the exams in the list."},"gradeKey":{"title":"Create Grading Keys","shortDescription":"Create a grading key with custom or default grade steps for a course or an exam.","descriptionTextOne":"Scores are helpful to assess individual exercises but at the end of a semester you and your students would like to see a standard grade. On the grading key page, you can have a grading key for each course and exam, define the grade steps by specifying intervals, the minimum passing grade and the lower/upper bound inclusivity. The default grading key can also be generated with a single click. Artemis then automatically handles mapping scores to grade steps or bonus points, as well as calculating student result statistics based on grade steps."},"submissionPolicy":{"title":"Specify Submission Policies","shortDescription":"Discourage trial-and-error approaches with submission penalty and lock repository policies.","descriptionTextOne":"Depending on the exercises and your teaching style, it might be useful to specify a submission policy. In general, lock repository and submission penalty policies combat trial-and-error solving approaches. When the student reaches the submission limit, the former prevents further submissions, while the latter results in a point deduction. Submission policies are initially specified in the creation process of a programming exercise and can later be adjusted in the grading configuration of the particular programming exercise."},"examExerciseUpdates":{"title":"Exercise Update during an Exam","shortDescription":"Update exercises during an exam and notify the students about the changes.","descriptionTextOne":"When you have to update the problem statement of an exercise during the exam, you can do this on the exercise edit page and notify the students about it and they will be able to see the updated problem statement."}}},"students":{"pageTitle":"Exam Features for Students","featureOverview":"Features Students","feature":{"localIDE":{"title":"Use Your IDE","shortDescription":"Clone the assignment and work on programming exercises on your IDE.","descriptionTextOne":"IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.

Every assessor is required to work through the example submissions and solutions before they can start assessing the students' exams. Additionally, the platform supports the assessment process with automatic and semi-automatic assessments for all supported exercise types. Quiz- and programming exercises are assessed automatically. This automatic assessment can be enhanced with manual assessment to further increase the accuracy of the evaluation. Artemis learns through machine learning which elements are correct and which are incorrect to further support the assessors. This feature can be enabled for text- and modeling exercises. When it is activated, it suggests how elements of the submissions should be evaluated during the course of further correction. The goal is to reduce the required effort and to increase the quality and fairness of the evaluation."},"onlineReview":{"title":"Online Exam Review","shortDescription":"Review the assessment of your exam from anywhere in the world.","descriptionTextOne":"After the results have been published, you can access your exam and review the assessment comfortably from your computer.
