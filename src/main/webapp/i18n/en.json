By providing personalized support and challenges, it helps students learn more efficiently, stay engaged, and achieve mastery at their own pace.","paragraph2":"In Artemis course competencies are the foundation for Adaptive Learning. They are overarching learning objectives that can be obtained by interacting with different lectures and exercises. Based on these competency models Artemis can offer students personalized learning paths that fit their individual needs.","title2":"Why?","paragraph3":"Competency-based education empowers students to master skills at their own pace, ensuring real progress and confidence. It creates a personalized, engaging learning experience that leads to better outcomes and long-term success. So, even without enabling learning paths, students benefit from being able to track their progress.","paragraph4":"With learning paths, students receive recommendations to support their learning efforts. Making it easier for them to master all the required competencies of a course."},"courseCompetencyCreation":{"title":"How to create a course competency?","paragraph1":"In general we distinguish between a competency and a prerequisite.","paragraph2":"To create a competency, click the 'Create Competency' button at the top of the competency page. On the creation page, you can specify a unique name and an appropriate description for the competency. Additionally, you have the option to set a recommended completion date, which indicates to students by when they should master the connected learning objects.","paragraph3":"You can also add taxonomy to the competency, providing students with greater insight into its purpose. If certain learning objects within this competency are optional, you can establish a threshold for when the competency will be considered mastered. You also have the option to mark the entire competency as optional.","paragraph4":"Finally, you can directly link lecture units to the competency. While you can also connect exercises to a competency, this must be done in the exercise edit/creation view.","paragraph5":"In addition to creating competencies or prerequisites yourself, you can also import them from other courses or utilize standardized competencies. For more information on this process, please refer to the user <a href={{ link }} target=\"_blank\">manual for Artemis.</a>"},"courseCompetencyRelations":{"title":"What are course competency relationships?","paragraph1":"Course competencies can support or rely on one another, which is why you can establish different types of relationships between them. Competencies can either MATCH, EXTEND, or REQUIRE each other. Detailed descriptions of these relationships are provided below.","paragraph2":"In summary:","paragraph3":"MATCH is about equivalency between two skills.<br />EXTEND is about building on an existing skill.<br />REQUIRE means one skill is a prerequisite for another.","paragraph4":"To create these relationships, open the 'Edit Relations' window. In this window, you can either select the related competencies or click on each one consecutively. After that, choose the desired relation type and create the relationship. To update or delete a relation, simply click on the specific relation and either update the relation type in the form or delete it.","relationVideoParagraph":{"first":"Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

If you have one, you already have the other, and they can be considered interchangeable.","exampleLabel":"Example:","relationParagraph2":"Competency A: Balancing on a stationary bike. Competency B: Standing on one leg (balancing without moving). Here, balancing on a stationary bike might \"MATCH\" with balancing on one leg because both involve the same fundamental skill of balance. If you can do one, you're very likely able to do the other, as the core competency (balance) is the same in both scenarios.","relationTitle2":"2. EXTEND","relationParagraph3":"This relationship means one competency adds complexity or expands on another. In other words, once you have mastered one competency, you can move on to mastering the extended one, which takes that skill further.","relationParagraph4":"Competency A: Riding a bike in a straight line. Competency B: Riding a bike around curves and turns. Riding in a straight line is the foundational skill that \"EXTENDS\" into riding around curves and turns. Competency B builds upon Competency A by adding the need to navigate changes in direction while maintaining balance and control. Once you can ride in a straight line, you're ready to extend that ability to more complex riding scenarios.","relationTitle3":"3. REQUIRES","relationParagraph5":"This relationship implies that one competency relies on another being already mastered. To perform the more advanced competency, the learner must first have the underlying skill or knowledge.","relationParagraph6":"Competency A: Riding a bike with confidence on flat terrain. Competency B: Riding a bike uphill. Riding a bike uphill \"REQUIRES\" that the learner has already mastered riding on flat terrain. The skill of riding on flat ground is a prerequisite because uphill riding adds more resistance and requires additional strength and technique.

Students may submit early if they wish.\n\nNo stable internet connection? Artemis saves all changes locally and automatically synchronizes every 30 seconds to avoid issues caused by unstable internet connections during the exam.\n\nOnce the exam is over, it is time to assess the submissions. Your assessment team may start grading exams from the Assessment Dashboard, which also visualizes overall progress.\n\nOnce all exams have been assessed you may release the results and give students the opportunity to review their result. If they believe to have found a mistake in their assessment, they may use the complaint feature to request a reassessment.

Additionally, you can set the period in which the students can review their results and complain if necessary.\n\nYou can add exercises using the Artemis exercise types. Exam exercises can have multiple variants and can be marked as \"non-mandatory\", which ensures that every student receives a unique exam.

The results will be published on the specified date. \n\nTest exams provide you with the possibility to provide students with a practice opportunity for the end-of-semester exam. The main difference is that you choose a working window within which students can freely start the exam. Students then have the configured working time to complete the exam. After submitting, students immediately get the automated assessment for programming and quizzes. Manual correction of the submissions is not necessary."},"exerciseTypes":{"title":"Multiple Exercise Types","shortDescription":"Programming, modeling, text, file-upload and quiz exercises.","descriptionTextOne":"Artemis supports programming, modeling, text, file-upload and quiz exercises with multiple-choice, drag and drop, and short answer questions in exam mode.\n\nFor programming exercises, students may choose to work with the online code editor or to clone the repository and work on the exercise in the integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice. Artemis uses the integrated and easy-to-use Apollon Editor for modeling exercises. It supports multiple diagram types, including UML class, activity, object, use case, communication, component, and deployment diagrams, as well as Petri nets and syntax trees. Your students can create models by intuitively dragging and dropping objects into the editor and connecting them using the appropriate arrows.
