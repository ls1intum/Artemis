You can create exams for each course and register all or a selection of your students. Within the exam, you can set up programming, modeling, text, file-upload and quiz exercises, or import existing ones. Before releasing the exam to your students, you can conduct test runs to make sure everything is running smoothly. Define a working time for the exam and adjust for individual students as needed. Students may submit early if they wish.\n\nNo stable internet connection? Artemis saves all changes locally and automatically synchronizes every 30 seconds to avoid issues caused by unstable internet connections during the exam.\n\nOnce the exam is over, it is time to assess the submissions. Your assessment team may start grading exams from the Assessment Dashboard, which also visualizes overall progress.\n\nOnce all exams have been assessed you may release the results and give students the opportunity to review their result. If they believe to have found a mistake in their assessment, they may use the complaint feature to request a reassessment. A second assessor will then be able to re-assess the submission and decide whether to accept or reject the complaint.\n\nFinally, Artemis also creates a statistical report of the exam to evaluate and examine your students' performance.\n\nCreate, conduct, & assess, all within Artemis!"

Additionally, you can set the period in which the students can review their results and complain if necessary.\n\nYou can add exercises using the Artemis exercise types. Exam exercises can have multiple variants and can be marked as \"non-mandatory\", which ensures that every student receives a unique exam. Additionally, you can randomize the exercise order of every student's exam to further impede cheating.\n\nYou can register students in bulk by importing them from a CSV file, from all students registered in the exam course, or by selecting manually from all users registered on Artemis.

For programming exercises, you can create a test suite, which for example applies structural and behavioral tests. These tests are then automatically executed for each student's submission at the end of the exam and evaluated accordingly. You can adjust the weight of each test, assign bonus points, and use static analysis tools to further support your assessment. All static analysis rules can be weighted independently, and you can define limits on how many points should be deducted if the same error occurs more than once. Finally, the automatic evaluation of programming tasks can be checked and confirmed or overwritten through manual evaluation. \n\nFor text and modeling exercises, you can activate automatic correction suggestions. Artemis uses machine learning to identify similar elements across submissions.
