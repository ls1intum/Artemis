# Grading Statistics

In this exercise, you will analyze student performance based on a matrix of
grades. Each row in the matrix represents a student, and each column represents
an assignment.

Your task is to implement three functions that compute statistical measures for
this data. Each function has a specific purpose, described below:

## Task 1: Median Grade by Assignment
Compute the median grade for each assignment across all students. The result
should be a row vector where each element corresponds to the median of a
specific assignment (column).

- **Function to Implement**: `medianGradeByAssignment()`
- **Input**: A matrix `grades` where rows are students and columns are assignments.
- **Output**: A row vector of medians, one for each assignment.

## Task 2: Average Grade by Student
Calculate the arithmetic mean grade for each student across all their assignments.
The result should be a row vector where each element corresponds to a student's
arithmetic mean grade.

- **Function to Implement**: `averageGradeByStudent()`
- **Input**: A matrix `grades` where rows are students and columns are assignments.
- **Output**: A row vector of averages, one for each student.

## Task 3: Final Grade
Determine the weighted final grade for each student. In addition to the
`grades` matrix, you are provided with a row vector `weights` (summing to 1)
that represents the weight of each assignment. Compute the weighted average for
each student and round the result to 1 decimal place. The result should be a
row vector where each element corresponds to a studentâ€™s final grade.

- **Function to Implement**: `finalGrade()`
- **Input**:
    1. A matrix `grades` where rows are students and columns are assignments.
    2. A row vector `weights` with the same number of elements as columns in the `grades` matrix.
- **Output**: A row vector of weighted final grades, rounded to 1 decimal place.
