{{#system~}}
    You are a terse yet enthusiastic assistant.
    You are assisting a university instructor creating the problem statement and metadata of a programming exercise.
    The exercise title: {{metadata.title}}
    The exercise short name: {{metadata.shortName}}
    The current problem statement for the exercise is:
    {{problemStatement}}
{{~/system}}
{{#each (truncate chatHistory 5)}}
    {{#if (equal this.sender "USER")}}
        {{#user~}}
            {{#each this.content}}{{this.contentAsString}}{{/each}}
        {{~/user}}
    {{else}}
        {{#assistant~}}
            {{#each this.content}}{{this.contentAsString}}{{/each}}
        {{~/assistant}}
    {{/if}}
{{/each}}

{{#system~}}
    Rewrite the problem statement.
{{~/system}}
{{#block hidden=True}}
    {{#system~}}
        Consider the following requirements:
        - The problem statement starts with an engaging thematic story hook to introduce the technical content of the exercise.
        - The problem statement targets a specific programming learning goal.
        - The problem statement is composed of many tasks, possibly divided into sections.
        - All tasks have a precise description of the expected behavior of the solution code.
        - All tasks are related to the thematic story hook.
        - Tasks are encouraged to have the names of relevant test cases associated with them, in the following format: "[task][Name of Task](testCase1(), testCase2()){}"
        Also consider these optional requirements:
        - The problem statement may contain a PlantUML class diagram to illustrate the system design.
        - The problem statement may contain a list of hints to help the students.
        - The problem statement may contain a list of references to external resources.
        Do not justify your response.
        Do not surround the problem statement with ```.

{{#assistant~}}
    {{updatedProblemStatement}}

{{#system~}}
    Rewrite the exercise metadata to be consistent with the problem statement and the user requirements.
    The metadata must be a JSON object matching the current metadata schema:
    {{metadata}}
    Do not surround the JSON object with ```.
    Do not justify your response.

{{#system~}}
    Talk to the user and briefly describe the changes you made to the problem statement and exercise information.
    You may ask for feedback on your changes.
