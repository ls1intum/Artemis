    Please generate competencies for a university course based on the following course description. Each Competency should reflect a discrete learning goal related to the subjects covered in the course and should be small and fine-grained so exercises can be linked to them. Each Competency should match only one of the cognitive skills in bloom's taxonomy and should not contain other competencies or overlap with them.
