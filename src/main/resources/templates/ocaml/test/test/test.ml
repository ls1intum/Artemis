(** main tests file

    This template is set up to test submissions in public tests with a few
    hand-picked inputs and then to use qcheck for comprehensive tests after the
    submission due date.

    if some things here appear to be somewhat complicated, it is most likely
    to reuse as much code as possible between public and hidden tests and to
    give the same feedback for both.

    If you do not want to use hidden tests, simply remove all "|> hidden"
    If you use hidden tests you must adjust the exercise working time in run.sh

    It is of course possible to use ounit directly but it should generally not
    be necessary with this framework

(** a function that checks if the students submission if correct for some input (use tuples if the functions has more than one argument)
    usually it is enough to just call assert_equal like this
    the printer argument is for the result type of the tested function
    if there is more than one possible result, it is usually possible to provide a custom comparison function cmp that takes care of the differences
    if not, you can wrap the function result in some other type, to provide the comparison function with enough data to determine if the result is valid
    or you could just drop assert_equal entirely, but it takes care of a bunch of things to make things pretty for students
