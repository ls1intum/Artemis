            Set the is_course_wide value to true for course-wide channels that have been created before this flag existed.
            On the first hand, these are lecture and exercise channels, identified by an existing lecture_id or exercise_id.
            On the other hand, these are the 4 default channels (announcement, organization, random, tech-support) created on course creation,
            identified by the absence of a creator and no association with a tutorial group.
