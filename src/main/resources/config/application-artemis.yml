        # Some CI systems, like Jenkins, offer a specific token that gets checked against any incoming notifications
        # from a VCS trying to trigger a build plan. Only if the notification request contains the correct token, the plan
        # is triggered. This can be seen as an alternative to sending an authenticated request to a REST API and then
        # triggering the plan.
        # In the case of Artemis, this is only really needed for the Jenkins + GitLab setup, since the GitLab plugin in
        # Jenkins only allows triggering the Jenkins jobs using such a token. Furthermore, in this case, the value of the
        # hudson.util.Secret is stored in the build plan, so you also have to specify this encrypted string here and NOT the actual token value itself!
        # You can get this by GETting any job.xml for a job with an activated GitLab step and your token value of choice.
