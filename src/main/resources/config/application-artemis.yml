        # In the case of Artemis, this is only really needed for the Jenkins + GitLab setup, since the GitLab plugin in
        # Jenkins only allows triggering the Jenkins jobs using such a token. Furthermore, in this case, the value of the
        # hudson.util.Secret is stored in the build plan, so you also have to specify this encrypted string here and NOT the actual token value itself!
