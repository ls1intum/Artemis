jenkins:
    # The following (optional) parameter allows to customize if Jenkins CSRF protection should be used (activated) within Artemis:
    # see https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API --> CSRF Protection
    # The default value for this parameter is true, so if it is not specified, crumb protection will be active.
    # If you experience problems using crumb, you can deactivate it here.
    use-crumb: true

    # The following (optional) parameter allows to enable the use of pseudonyms.
    # If activated, the user's first and last name are not transferred to jenkins.
    # Instead the user will be called "user <loginname>".
    use-pseudonyms: false

    # You can override the CI and VCS URLs that are used internally by Artemis.
    # This is useful when the internal communication is
    # different to how clients should access those services.
    # The client-facing URLs (e.g. for the repository clone URL, link to the build plans)
    # will still be constructed from the ones defined in application-artemis.yml.
    internal-urls:
        # Override the ci url used as the webhook url.
        ci-url: # http://jenkins:8080
