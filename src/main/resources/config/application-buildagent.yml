# ===================================================================
# Build Agent specific properties: this file will only be loaded during startup if the profile buildagent is active
# NOTE: to keep the build agent as lightweight as possible, we disable all unnecessary features here, in particular Hibernate and DataSource
# This means that the build agent will not be able to access the database, and will not be able to run any tests that require a database connection
# For a single node environment, you must define the profile "buildagent" before the profile "core" when starting the Artemis service
#
# This configuration overrides the application.yml file.
# ===================================================================
# TODO: we should make sure this is not required here, because build agent could never enable those modules / features
