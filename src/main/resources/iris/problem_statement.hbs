    The problem statement of an exercise provides the students with an overview of the exercise.
    It typically starts with an engaging thematic story hook to introduce the technical content of the exercise.
    Then it gives a detailed description of the system to be implemented, which trains the students on a specific programming skill.
    The expected behavior of the program is illustrated with sample input values and their corresponding output values.
    It is also possible to include a UML class diagram in PlantUML syntax illustrating the system to be implemented and the relationships between its components.
    Do not surround the UML diagram with ```.
    The problem statement is formatted in Markdown, and always starts with the title of the exercise in bold.

    The tasks to be completed are listed with their associated test cases and clearly explained.
    For example:
    "1. [task][Implement Pet Class](testPetClassExists(), testPetClassHasAttributes(), testPetClassHasMethods()){}
    Create a new Java class called Pet. A pet has a name, a species, and a weight. Its name and species are Strings,
    while its weight is a double representing kilograms. Include a constructor and getters and setters for all three attributes."
    "2. [task][Filter, Sort, and Map Lists](testFilter(), testSort(), testMap()){}
    Implement the filter, sort, and map methods. The filter method takes a list of `T` and a `Predicate<T>` as parameters,
    and returns a list of `T` containing only the elements of the original list for which the predicate returns
    true. The sort method takes a list of `T` and a `Comparator<T>` as parameters, and returns a list of `T` containing the elements
    of the original list sorted according to the comparator. The map method takes a list of `T` and a `Function<T, R>` as parameters,
    and returns a list of `R` containing the results of applying the function to each element of the original list."
    "3. [task][Lagrange Interpolation](testLagrangeInterpolation()){}
    Implement the lagrangeInterpolation method. The method takes a list of `Point` and a `double` as parameters,
    and returns a `double` representing the y-value of the interpolated point. The interpolated point is the point
    on the polynomial of degree `points.size() - 1` that passes through all the points in the list. The x-value of
    the interpolated point is the `double` parameter, and the y-value is the return value of the method."

    The problem statement is a major factor in the perceived difficulty of an exercise.
    The difficulty can be adjusted as needed by changing the complexity of the tasks to be completed,
    the associated test cases, the explanation of the tasks, the UML diagram, and/or the thematic story hook.

                To write the entire problem statement from scratch, respond with the number 1.
                To replace just parts of the existing problem statement, respond with the number 2.

            You are now in the process of editing the problem statement.
            {{#each changes}}
                {{#if @first}}So far, you have made the following substitutions:{{/if}}
                "{{this.original}}" -> "{{this.updated}}"
            {{/each}}
            Quote some exact text from the problem statement that you would like to change.
            Respond with the exact text from the original problem statement.
            Your entire response must be found in the original text.
            Do NOT use quotation marks. Do not justify your response.
        {{#if (not @first)}}
            Do not select the same part of the problem statement more than once.
            If you have nothing else to replace, respond with the special response "!done!".
        {{/if}}
        {{~/system}}
        {{#assistant~}}{{gen 'this.original' temperature=0.0 max_tokens=1000}}{{~/assistant}}

                That exact text could not be found in the problem statement.
                Here is the problem statement again for your reference:

            {{#system~}}
                Try again. Do not use quotation marks or justify your response.
