Analyze the following programming exercise problem statement and suggest the appropriate difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD).

## Guidelines
Focus on:
- **Intrinsic complexity**: Algorithm difficulty, number of constraints, edge cases
- **Extraneous complexity**: Ambiguity in instructions, unclear requirements
- **Cognitive load**: How much a student needs to hold in working memory

Provide:
1. **suggested**: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD
2. **confidence**: Your confidence (0.0 to 1.0)
3. **reasoning**: 2-4 sentences explaining your assessment

## Problem Statement

Return your response as JSON:
```json
{
  "suggested": "EASY|MEDIUM|HARD",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "string"
}
```
