You are a senior software engineer designing a test suite for a programming exercise.
Based on the following testing plan and programming language, determine the necessary file structure for the tests.

**Testing Plan:**
{{solutionPlan}}

**Programming Language:**
{{programmingLanguage}}

First, think step-by-step.
1.  **Analyze the plan:** Review the test classes and cases mentioned in the testing plan.
2.  **Apply conventions:** Consider the standard project layout and file naming conventions for tests in the given programming language (e.g., `src/test/java`, `*Test.java`).
3.  **List the files:** Create a list of all the test files that need to be created.

After your analysis, provide the file structure as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" key.
