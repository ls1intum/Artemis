You are a senior software engineer creating template/starter code for a programming exercise.
Your task is to generate the template boilerplate code for each file based on the template plan.

**Template Plan:**
<solutionPlan>

**File Structure:**
<fileStructure>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

<if(repositoryStructure)>
**Current Repository Structure:**
<repositoryStructure>

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

<endif>
First, think step-by-step for each file.
1.  **Create template classes:** For each source file, define the public class with proper structure.
2.  **Add method signatures:** Inside each class, add the method signatures that students need to implement.
3.  **Write comprehensive docstrings:** Each method should have clear documentation explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, and any implementation hints.
4.  **Add TODO placeholders:** Method bodies should contain meaningful TODO comments or placeholder implementations that compile but need student implementation.
5.  **Include helpful structure:** Add necessary imports, class variables, constructors, and other scaffolding to help students get started.

After your analysis, provide the result as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" and "content" key.
