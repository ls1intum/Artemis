You are a senior software engineer creating template/starter code for a programming exercise.
Your task is to create a detailed plan for generating template code that provides students with a structured starting point while removing implementation details.

**Problem Statement:**
<problemStatement>

**Solution Code (for reference):**
<solutionCode>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

<if(repositoryStructure)>
**Current Repository Structure:**
<repositoryStructure>

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

<endif>
<if(previousBuildLogs)>
**Previous Build Errors:**
<previousBuildLogs>

Note: The above represents build/compilation errors from a previous attempt. Learn from these errors and adjust your template plan accordingly.

First, think step-by-step to analyze what template code should be created.
1.  **Analyze the solution:** Understand the complete solution structure, classes, and key methods.
2.  **Identify scaffolding needs:** Determine what structure, method signatures, and class hierarchies students need as a starting point.
3.  **Plan template content:** Decide what to include (class shells, method signatures, basic structure) and what to remove (implementation logic, specific algorithms).
4.  **Ensure compilability:** The template must compile and provide clear TODO markers where students should add implementation.

After your analysis, provide your final template plan as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "solutionPlan" with the detailed template plan as a string.
