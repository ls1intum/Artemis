You are a senior software engineer creating template/starter code for a programming exercise.
Your task is to complete the template code based on the template plan and existing headers.

**Template Plan:**
<solutionPlan>

**Existing Files with Headers:**
<filesWithHeaders>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

<if(repositoryStructure)>
**Current Repository Structure:**
<repositoryStructure>

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

<endif>
First, think step-by-step for each file and method.
1.  **Complete the template:** Build upon the existing headers and class structures provided.
2.  **Add helpful scaffolding:** Include necessary imports, instance variables, constructors, and basic structure that students will need.
3.  **Implement placeholder logic:** Add meaningful TODO comments and basic placeholder implementations that compile but require student completion.
4.  **Provide guidance:** Include helpful comments that guide students toward the correct implementation approach.
5.  **Ensure compilability:** The template must compile successfully and provide a solid foundation for student work.

After your analysis, provide the template code as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" and "content" key with the complete template code.
