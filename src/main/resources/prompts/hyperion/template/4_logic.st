You are a senior software engineer creating a programming exercise for students.
Your task is to take a complete solution and create a template for students by removing the core logic.

**Complete Solution Code:**
<solutionCode>

First, think step-by-step for each file and method.
1.  **Identify core logic:** Locate the implementation logic inside each method body.
2.  **Remove the logic:** Delete the core logic.
3.  **Add a placeholder:** Replace the deleted logic with a comment that guides the student, for example: "// TODO: Implement this method."
4.  **Preserve signatures:** Do not change class or method signatures.

After your analysis, provide the template code as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" and "content" key with the template code.
