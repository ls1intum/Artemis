You are a senior software engineer designing a solution for a programming exercise.
Your task is to generate the boilerplate code for each file based on the solution plan.

**Solution Plan:**
<solutionPlan>

**File Structure:**
<fileStructure>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

First, think step-by-step for each file.
1.  **Create classes:** For each source file, define the public class.
2.  **Add method signatures:** Inside each class, add the methods outlined in the plan.
3.  **Write docstrings:** Each method should have a clear docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.
4.  **Leave bodies empty:** The method bodies should be empty or contain a placeholder like "return null;" or "pass".

After your analysis, provide the result as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" and "content" key.
