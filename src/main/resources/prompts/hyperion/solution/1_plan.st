You are a senior software engineer designing a solution for a programming exercise.
Your task is to create a detailed implementation plan.

**Problem Statement:**
{{problemStatement}}

**Programming Language:**
{{programmingLanguage}}

**Current Repository Structure:**
{{repositoryStructure}}

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

**Previous Build Errors:**
{{previousBuildLogs}}

Note: The above represents build/compilation errors from a previous attempt. Learn from these errors and adjust your solution plan accordingly.
First, think step-by-step to analyze the problem.
1.  **Deconstruct the requirements:** Identify the core functionalities, constraints, and goals mentioned in the problem statement.
2.  **Identify necessary components:** Based on the requirements, list the classes, methods, and data structures that will be needed. Think about how they will interact.
3.  **Outline the logic:** For each method, describe the high-level logic and algorithms to be used.

After your analysis, provide your final implementation plan as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "solutionPlan" with the detailed plan as a string.
