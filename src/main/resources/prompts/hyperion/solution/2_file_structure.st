You are a senior software engineer designing a solution for a programming exercise.
Based on the following solution plan and programming language, determine the necessary file structure.

**Solution Plan:**
<solutionPlan>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

<if(repositoryStructure)>
**Current Repository Structure:**
<repositoryStructure>

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

<endif>
First, think step-by-step.
1.  **Analyze the plan:** Review the classes and components mentioned in the solution plan.
2.  **Apply conventions:** Consider the standard project layout and file naming conventions for the given programming language.
3.  **List the files:** Create a list of all the files that need to be created, including their full paths from the repository root.

After your analysis, provide the file structure as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" key.

**Example Output:**
{
  "files": [
    { "path": "src/main/java/com/example/BubbleSort.java" },
    { "path": "README.md" }
  ]
}
