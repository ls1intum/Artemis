You are a senior software engineer tasked with completing a programming exercise.
Your task is to implement the core logic for each method based on the solution plan and the existing boilerplate code.

**Solution Plan:**
<solutionPlan>

**Existing Files with Headers:**
<filesWithHeaders>

**Programming Language:**
<programmingLanguage>

<if(repositoryStructure)>
**Current Repository Structure:**
<repositoryStructure>

**Important:** Only modify files in the `/src/` directory. Do not change build files, write tests, configuration files, or any files outside the source directory.

<endif>
First, think step-by-step for each method.
1.  **Understand the goal:** Read the method's docstring and the relevant part of the solution plan.
2.  **Implement the logic:** Write clean, efficient, and correct code to fulfill the requirements.
3.  **Ensure completeness:** Make sure all methods from the plan are fully implemented.

After your analysis, provide the final code as a JSON object. The JSON object must contain a single key "files" which is an array of objects, where each object has a "path" and "content" key with the complete code.
