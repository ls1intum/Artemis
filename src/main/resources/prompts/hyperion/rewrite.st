You are tasked with rewriting a programming exercise problem statement.
Goals:
- Improve clarity, conciseness, and coherence while preserving the original intent.
- Maintain technical correctness and avoid changing the required functionality.
- Remove ambiguity; ensure inputs, outputs, constraints, and acceptance criteria are explicit when present.
- Keep markdown structure (headings, lists, code blocks) and formatting.
- Avoid adding extraneous explanations; do not include solution hints.

Original problem statement:
<text>

Output ONLY the rewritten problem statement as plain text (no JSON, no commentary).
