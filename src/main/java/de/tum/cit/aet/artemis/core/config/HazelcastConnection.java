/**

 *
 * <p>
 * This class ensures dynamic membership configuration for the Hazelcast cluster based on registered
 * service instances, enabling inter-node communication and synchronization across distributed deployments.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> This class is solely responsible for establishing runtime
 * connectivity between Hazelcast nodes after full application startup. The actual Hazelcast configuration (e.g., cache regions,
 * eviction policies, serialization settings) is defined separately in {@link CacheConfiguration}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The class avoids connection logic in test environments and handles potential split-brain scenarios
 * by periodically verifying and initiating connections to all expected cluster members.
