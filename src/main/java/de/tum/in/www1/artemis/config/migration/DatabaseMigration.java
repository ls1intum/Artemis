 * Steps for new database migration paths:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Re-create the new initial scheme from the database after applying all existing liquibase migrations.</li>
 * <li>Delete all existing liquibase migrations except the new initial scheme and *_cleanup.xml (adapt *_cleanup.xml with the latest date).</li>
 * <li>Delete all Java migrations that have been executed before.</li>
 * <li>Check that the new initial scheme is compatible with MySQL and Postgres and can be started from scratch in both environments.</li>
 * <li>Add the new migration path in the constructor of DatabaseMigration.</li>
 * <li>Verify that the migration works with the designated path (ideally with a local database and with a dump from a test / production system).</li>
 * <li>Document the migration carefully in the release notes and the online documentation.</li>
