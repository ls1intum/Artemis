             * This configuration addresses a performance issue related to the initial request
             * to the Spring server taking significantly longer (8 seconds or more) than subsequent
             * requests (around 100ms). In our case, this happened with the PostContextFilter class
             * when fetching conversation messages.
             * The reason for this delay is that Spring needs to introspect the class used as a parameter
             * for the request handler method. It does so by scanning the classpath with multiple classloaders
             * to find BeanInfo files.
             * However, the Tomcat Embedded Classloader has two problems:
             * 1. It is slow because it searches for JAR files inside other JAR files, which is a
             * time-consuming operation.
             * 2. By default, it discards its cache every 15 minutes, causing the performance issue
             * to reappear later when the search is performed again.
             * To address these issues, we've customized the TomcatServletWebServerFactory with two
             * changes:
             * - Set the context's reloadable attribute to false, preventing Tomcat from discarding
             * the loaded classes and refreshing.
             * - Use ExtractingRoot for the context's resources, instructing Tomcat to extract
             * packages on startup (which requires more disk space) instead of scanning through
             * un-extracted packages.
