/**
 * NOTE: This class provides inner classes for use with @JsonView
 *
 * JsonView can be used to serialize only select properties of an entity to JSON before sending it to the client. Mark attributes in the domain classes
 * with @JsonView(QuizView.xxx.class) to include that attribute in the xxx view. Attributes without annotations are not serialized by default, if a view is used. This
 * means, we have to annotate all properties we want to serialize (white-listing) To use it in a REST response, you have to return a MappingJacksonValue object instead of
 * the domain object itself. (Alternatively ResponseEntity<MappingJacksonValue>) create it like this (replace 'QuizView.During' with the view you want to use): Object
 * yourDomainObject = ...; MappingJacksonValue payload = new MappingJacksonValue(yourDomainObject); Class view = QuizView.During.class;
 * payload.setSerializationView(view); return payload; To use it in a WebSocket message, make it write the value as bytes and send those directly: - use
 * messagingTemplate.send() instead of messagingTemplate.convertAndSend() - objectMapper should be the mapper used by the injected MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter
 * Object yourDomainObject = ...; Class view = QuizView.During.class; byte[] payload = objectMapper.writerWithView(view).writeValueAsBytes(yourDomainObject);
 * messagingTemplate.send("/topic/some/path/", MessageBuilder.withPayload(payload).build());
